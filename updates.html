		<p>Was hanging out with Sylvie-deer at the Deer Pond when a couple wolves—Demon (ParanorMel) and North (TiltedCactus)—came blazing in howling and barking. Immediately spooked, stone got to his hooves to observe their direction. Seeing it was toward him, he began to retreat at a trot. Whether they were actually interested in him or not was unclear, and in some ways, irrelevant.</p>
		
		<p>Feeling circled, his plan of escape shifted to hunkering down and hoping for the best. He crouched and slowly made his way to bushes, hoping they might be enough to obscure him. Though unsure if he was observed or not, the wolves continued to half-circle around him as he went between bushes hoping to gain some distance.</p>
		
		<p>To his horror, Sylvie-deer approached and initiated brief conversation, though seemed more confused by the end than they were at the beginning. When the wolves left, he somewhat herded Sylvie-deer with him away to the West, where they sheltered in thick grasses in a copse of trees near food and within a short walk of water. Finally began to de-stress somewhat there.</p>
		
		<p>Fortunately, they were then joined by Stria, after which almost all of his immediate apprehension evaporated. When it began to storm, they sought refuge under the rock overhang at the edge of the Westernmost pond.</p>
		
		<p>Until stone heard a howl, then spotted Demon hunting a rabbit while he was heading toward grazing plants on the opposite side of the pond. Spooked again, he bolted back to the relative safety of the herd, and managed to persuade Stria from her sit with the promise to return to the more ample food uphill. They nestled under the boughs of a dense conifer through the remainder of the rain, occasionally seeing movement and hearing wolf howls to which Sylvie-deer was largely indifferent and Stria was aware but unconcerned. Stone however, in his typical fashion, could not relax and any time he would see or hear Demon, was immediately back to his hooves until he felt the threat may have passed. He remained vigilant for some time after (and enabled PvP which I have not figured out a good way to write in-character).</p>
		
		<p><s>Hum missed Demon coming near enough to utter a, "Tempting..." which stone is still mad about.</s> Sensing something was wrong, stone responded to Stria's sudden tension. Demon was back. The pair stood, sussing out the wolf's location. Stone began to herd them around the pond where he supposed Demon lurked, away from the lake and cliffside against which they were presently cornered (and toward the ley stones where Stria could also enable PvP).</p>
		
		<p>Standing by towering stones, he squinted into the rain, trying to spot movement in the lightning strikes. Scent was no good, all he could pick up was water and their own apprehension.</p>
		
		<p>It came as something of a shock to him when he felt teeth close against his leg, cutting him as he kicked—and missed—out of instinct. Bolting and turning, he widened the distance between himself and the wolf, forming a circle of himself and Stria at the outer edges with Demon in the center. There was another scuffle, another nip to his haunches, and another missed counter-attack. With Stria at his side, they stared down the wolf brave or foolish enough to pursue them.</p>
		
		<p>(Credit: the following is mostly direct quotes from the RP, and consequently is co-authored by ParanorMel.)</p>
		
		<p>"Would it be worth fighting two stags?" the wolf mused, seemingly to himself. "No, probably not..." He huffed, clearly frustrated.</p>
		
		<p>"Your nose isn't working but I'll let you wonder where you're wrong," stone replied, hoping his petty insult would linger on the wolf's mind where the sangai's physical blows had failed to land.</p>
		
		<p>Demon lifted his eyes, surprised. "... You speak."</p>
		
		<p>"Most seem to." He was somewhere between irritated and offended, both that the wolf hadn't yet known and that it might matter to begin with. Some of stone's best friends didn't speak. As if in confirmation, Stria let out a burp.</p>
		
		<p>"Not where I'm from," the wolf mumbled, frowning. He seemed concerned about something, preoccupied, as if he wasn't just moments ago attempting to threaten stone and Stria's lives.</p>
		
		<p>"Then you should go back there." The stag's tone was as unfriendly as it was stern. He was eager to avoid further confrontation.</p>
		
		<p>Frowning, Demon shifted his gaze away from the deer. "Yeah. Wish I could." He appeared concerned, and sad. "... You don't happen to know, uh, which realm this is?" He sat down, appearing less hostile, somewhat desperate.</p>
		
		<p>The stone balancer hadn't yet considered it at length, apart from being grateful for respite from The Endless Forest and its more direct contact with Magic. 'The Reach' echoed in his mind. He memorized it, considered for a moment before uttering, "No."</p>
		
		<p>"... I'm sorry... I didn't realize," he sighed, getting to his paws. "Thanks anyway. And, uh... Sorry."</p>
		
		<p>The sangai looked irritated and angry. Without a hint of forgiveness, he offered: "I understand."</p>
		
		<p>Demon picked up his pace as he left, seeming bothered and distracted by his own thoughts. Both stone and Stria watched him leave, stone entirely unconcerned with the wolf's issues beyond how they affected Stria and himself.</p>
		
		<p>Following this, neither Stria nor stone were content to return to anywhere they'd been, and instead travelled to the Quarry Pond to the Northeast. There they rested for the better part of a day, until more trouble found them in the form of Velos (TiltedCactus), who also briefly startled Ishmatael (ParanorMel). By this point quite impatient with being harassed, stone decided that if being reactive hadn't worked, he would try being proactive. He approached Velos, at a walk, stare unbroken. No threat displays, no signs of caution—just a slow approach and unbroken stare. His bluff seemed to work, as Velos certainly kept his distance.</p>
		
		<p>At the first opportunity, stone and Stria broke from the confrontation and ran far East, finding greenery enough to nourish them for a long hideaway. There they were, finally, unbothered for the remainder of their time before stone returned to The Dark Place, the one place stone always ended up coming back to no matter where his waking journeys took him.</p>

		<p>Having spent around four days on his island in-and-out of the Reach, he finally made his way back to Deer Pond for some socialization.</p>
		
		<p>Has run into old friends and made new acquaintances alike. Found another, larger pond to the East of Deer Pond which is often less populated and to which he has been withdrawing at times.</p>

		<p>After a day well spent at the "Deer Pond", he ventured out on his own to bed down. Finding a large pond with an island at the center, he could not resist and swam out to it. Settling into a nestle of bushes, he felt the most comfortable he had been alone since leaving his home nine years before.</p>

		<p>Awoke, but not where he expected.</p>

		<p>Perhaps by magic, perhaps something else, he was not in The Endless Forest.</p>
		
		<p>Initially wary, he scented few predators. What few he detected were canine, and smaller than him, and disinterested. He encountered others he recognized, though somehow now more vivid than they had been, more alive.</p>
		
		<p>And Stria. And he was settled, this place was where he would like to stay, if he could. Plenty of food and water, and so much space. More space for him to run than he had in so, so long. He ran. He ran to explore, he ran to find others. He ran for the joy of it. He slept in sunbeams and swam in ponds. It was not home, it was not the Forest, but it was almost an in-between. A compromise. And he was happy.</p>
		
		<p>(Like many, I have become caught up in Reach of the River. Perhaps permanently. I can see this usurping TEF as where I go to RP stone, depending on the direction Wrought takes its development. And I'm loving every moment of it.)</p>

		<p>Guided by what I can only assume is profound hatred for his Mortal Enemy, he was called to the Forest to defend the Herd (today consisting of Falea, Dusty, Dusky, Sigalla) from Greitai's circling.</p>
		
		</p>After about ten minutes of ear drops, hard looks, sidling, stomping, antler threats, boxing, and yelling, he found himself in an extremely close stare-down with the raptor-hybrid. Hate-filled breaths plumed into one another's faces, their tension spoke more than any words could. Recognizing a standoff with a stag too stubborn yield when she had wanted an easy victory, she eventually backed down, and he did not dare antagonize her interest as she yielded the impasse. Was sniffed by Falea and Dusty, but hardly returned beyond a slight huff and nudge. He faced the direction Greitai and UY departed in, convinced that nothing was ever over with her, just a temporary reprieve.</p>

		<p>Has had an absolutely lovely day. First entered the Forest and joined Elliot at his watch on Red Hill. Then, sensing her enter, hurried to greet Falea in the Birch, where the two sat in tall grasses for some time, eventually joined by Jalo for a while.</p>

		<p>After her departure, went to find Accendare as Elliot had since been joined by Róta (a fine companion) and Ezekiel (frankly terrifying at a glance). Though Accendare had scarcely ever acknowledged him, a distant acquaintance was better than solitude.</p>
		
		<p>After a while, found himself joined by Dusty. Eventually was motivated to go and graze in the Pond, partially by Dusty's apparent lack of familiarity with this part of the Forest. After a hearty munch, ended up sparking a brief carousal of play while shaking themselves dry, before they made their way to the more familiar Birch. Eventually settled in the grasses near the base of Red Hill, in part to take advantage of Elliot's vigilant nature.</p>
		
		<p>A good day became the best day because then Stria showed up. (:</p>

		<p>Showed up. Noticed Stria (with Circe). Abandoned a herd of TEN (Rusa, Elliot, Ruun, Talla, Falea, Dusty, Dusk, Smol, Róta, and Sigalla) to go hang out with her sleeping ass. I get it though.</p>

		<p>Naturally, missed a coordinated predator attack after going to the Dark Place a couple days back. Spent yesterday gathering willow branches and trying to coerce others into eating them for their pain-dulling effect, to some success but not entirely. Grew frustrated with his lack of ability to communicate intent with feral deer, but what can you do.</p>
		
		<p>Joined Rusa and Nyssbriel in the tall grass a bit too close to Greitai's den for comfort, but she was away sleeping at the Ruins so it seemed alright for now. Visited Elliot briefly, then returned. Much to his delight, who should come walking up not much later but the Irish elk himself! Then incidentally followed by Dusty as well!</p>
		
		<p>Gleefully hopped about like a yearling for perhaps a bit too long, making at least Rusa more nervous than not, but simply could not help himself. The energy of rut combined with his sentience and friendship meant at least a few wiggles were in order. After some vigilance, eventually settled down near his old friend.</p>
		
		<p>Joined by Smol who everyone seemed to unanimously decide was probably fine. Also maybe chewable?</p>
		
		<p>Naturally, then Hum was AFK for seven minutes to do laundry when a wild Matthew attacked! And Elliot took offense to that. A lot of it. For a while. Stone went to find Rusa, who eventually decided to return to the small gathering of Nyssbriel, Dusty, and Smol (who stone's hormones decided is part of the herd now, second stinky boy). Continued to scent the distance and circle anxiously.</p>
		
		<p>At one point, River came nearby, and in his paranoia he wasn't sure what to make of it, given the company she sometimes kept. She then went back off and he became aware that she had somehow joined the fray against Matthew. He was indeed pleased that he'd read her well initially, and thought he might somehow need to apologize later at some point. He continued his watch while things were decided well and far away from the herd.</p>
		
		<p>Joined by Ruun as stone left to check on Elliot, who was rather bloody but conspicuously not very wounded. The Irish elk rejoined the group for a moment before venturing to join River and Chrona, presumably to check on her. Stone debated a brief venture as well before concluding that Chrona was, indeed, too scary. The herd settled into an uneasy rest.</p>
		
		<p>Noticing River alone at the Crying Idol, stone briefly joined her, exchanging sniffs. Appreciative but not able to think of what to say, before he settled on anything to follow up with, she resumed her bath at its base. Hoping she was well, he turned to leave, though stopped to look back for a moment in thought before rejoining the herd.</p>

		<p>Had a nice sit with a few deer, including Falea, Dusk, Andras, Ksu, Syl's OOC Sylvie-deer, Honey Bell, and Dusty. Noticed Ruun off to the side, but didn't think he'd be able to persuade everyone to move, and Ruun was <i>out</i>.</p>
		
		<p>Briefly witnessed some sort of altercation between River, Chrona, and Pyriel. Just grateful they seemed to resolve things at a fair distance.</p>
		
		<p>Joined later by rusa much to his joy, and Jalo who he formally met (read: sniffed once. it counts.). Then joined by Nhozemphtehk. And then also Falea. Then Nyssbriel. Honestly, an impressive gathering, by his standards!</p>

		<p>Sat with Ross a while until after a brief hope, Ross elected to playfully pelt spell him. Ears fully dropped back in a gesture just shy of a full hard look (the first few stages to a feral deer's fighting body language), stone regarded Ross silently for an uncomfortably long period of time.</p>
		
		<p>Feeling hurt and betrayed by what was to him a deeply unnatural action due to his hatred for Forest Magic, having it used directly on his body left him feeling violated and disturbed. Still wordlessly, he left to wash the spell that disgusted him off in the Pond, and sit in the shallows to wash away the feelings of repulsion as well.</p>
		
		<p>Shortly following, Rossamund approached sheepishly, visibly remorseful and bearing flowers as a peace offering. Not even glancing his direction, stone stood and moved swiftly off to the dense grasses of the birch forest near De Drinkplaats, where he remained unbothered but still disturbed for some time. Stewed in his feelings of betrayal, disgust, and violation, he came mostly to feel hurt that this would be inflicted upon him by someone he trusted.</p>
		
		<p>Became cognitively aware that he ought to more thoroughly communicate not only his feelings, but his reasoning for them, to prevent this type of thing, and to help explain his reaction. Regardless of this awareness though, he couldn't bring himself to. The more upset he was, the less cognizant he became, and even when the feelings left him, somehow the act of speaking about them or their motivations similarly bothered him for reasons he could not understand.</p>
		
		<p>So, rather than clarify the situation using his words, he simply sat in an angry, wet, cold ball in the grass feeling badly for himself.</p>

		<p>Blobbed near Yasu, Nélida, and the young fawn Iraia until they responded to his presence and he felt comfortable approaching. Briefly greeted Yasu from a distance before being sniffed by Iraia and promptly having a bit of a hop-run. Then blobbed with the fawn while they were joined briefly by Eremes, who stone found mildly disconcerting but felt good enough about in Yasu's company. In time he left, and Ashira joined instead, who stone bumped into the day before and felt fine enough about. A few strangers, a lot of lazing.</p>

		<p>Upon waking today, noticed Accendare resting at the Crying Idol. Did not approach, but frowned to himself about it. Plans to investigate that further, but later.</p>
		
		<p>Bumped about from this acquaintance to that, eventually settling on Circe despite having the most awkward, distressed interaction the other day.

		<p>Awoke and sensed Stria. Only after reaching her and circling to settle, did he notice the giant tulips everywhere. Troubling, but giant food. Could be worse.</p>
		
		<p>Grew increasingly unsettled by activity nearby, which turned out to be something of a fight. Too many to keep track of, let alone name, though he did notice the black hind&mdash;Accendare&mdash;who'd already suffered some injuries. Though he did not want to let her be hurt, and possibly others involved, there was vastly too much going on to involve himself in.</p>
		
		<p>Even Stria stood from her nearly-asleep state, and while not affected by the fight, was visibly alert to it. Ears dropped, body tense, stone's instincts told him <i>run</i>. He did. Stria followed much more leisurely.</p>
		
		<p>They stood watching as the group came and went. Stone remained vigilant while Stria simply stood aware. When things seemed to settle, stone decided he didn't like who they were near and moved again, Stria clearly growing tired of all the walking.</p>
		
		<p>Hid, <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/300987331219947531/851634844001107978/unknown.png" target="_blank">very well in his opinion</a>, with Stria in the tall grasses of the Birch near the Idol. A bit later, someone settled near them who stone again did not care for, so he stood to leave. Stria was obviously very done with moving, though still felt obliged in her own way, though not without lamentations. Stone could not resist checking on Accendare, who had moved under the current of the Crying Idol. Stria, in her strong feels for the region, refused to follow.</p>
		
		<p>Accendare did eventually move out of the water, hefting herself with great effort just past the shore before all but collapsing. Disturbed with her injuries, irritated that he could and would not have interfered sooner, despite their complete lack of familiarity, stone settled what he hoped was a polite enough distance away. He did not feel welcomed. Stria passed the both of them and settled in the Birch, and he almost moved to follow her, but elected to give this just a bit more time.</p>
		
		<p>Any thoughts of leaving vanished when the hind stood again, limped a bit closer, and settled once more. Stone sniffed, concerned, yet unable to provide assistance. He settled again, eventually getting up to graze lightly, when he noticed Accendare stand. Still not sure if it really was his place, when she began to limp across the Forest, he followed, watching carefully those who they passed by. She crashed into a heap near the Playground, and rested.</p>
		
		<p>A while passed of her not moving. Standing to check, he sniffed at her and drew back quickly realizing she'd at some point passed away. Disturbed, ears pinned, he quickly left the corpse. He could not help the dead. Seeking out Stria, who was well into sleep, he settled at her side. Almost to himself, he admitted quietly: "She didn't make it." Feeling more than he cared to for something which years ago before this place was as natural as anything else, he muted himself to the thinking, settling into a wide-awake rest in the dirt by Stria's side.</p>

		<p>Was invited by Yasu to join a small group, meeting Kerosone's child&mdash;Kyokuu&mdash;and another older child&mdash;Sionnach&mdash;in the process. Human faces are weird but Kyokuu seemed alright. Had a small exchange with Yasu during which he certainly must have concerned her, being fairly quiet and relatively out of it due to having slept so much of the past few years. In truth, he was fine, just didn't have much to say.</p>
		
		<p>Was tasked with watching Kyo for a few minutes while Yasu followed Ross who'd followed Sionnach who was likely off getting into trouble. Took the task as seriously as ever, though everything seemed to be fine. Left without consequence not long after everyone else had.</p>

		<p>Elected to manifest from The Dark Place for a short time. Tried flirting with a couple cute girls but nothing came of it. Oh stone, will you ever learn.</p>
		
		<p>Surprise it's Murph!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For a second refused to believe it just due to the fear he was wrong, but was confirmed when she plowed into him with all the force a critter her size could. Had a bit of a hop about and some sits and was just generally pleased to see her, though wondered to himself where she'd picked up the feathers. Ah well, these things do happen here, he supposed.</p>
		
		<p> Having always been aware of a Nélida sleeping in the background, herded an all too eager Murph toward her just due to safety in numbers, taking note of the young Tuli who sat watching nearby. Never one to turn his nose up to the potential to adopt what seemed to be a relatively feral-normal deer into his group, and with his characteristic bias toward those a bit too wee to be left entirely to their own volition, was pleasantly rewarded by Murph insinuating he must be at least somewhat trustworthy merely by being in good health and spirits. Greeted Tuli with a sniff, then things got out of hand partially because I forgot how to hotkeys and there are two young'uns about. After several hops and such, they eventually settled into a sunspot in a patch of blueberries near a sleeping Nélida. All felt as it should be.</p>

		<p>Having finished shedding his velvet, joined a pile of Stria, Circe, Ronra, and a slightly aside lil vampdeer who, if not for her size, would have given him some pause. Stayed a long while.</p>
		
		<p>Noticing Ruun had been sitting off in the Birch a long time, went to check in with him, and was invited to a sprint with hops. Gladly partook, engaging with a pair of fawns for a time, eventually settling with the red stag in the Blue Bowl until his departure, then returned to Stria until stone's own departure to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go some time later.</p>

Circe eventually joined, and I'm told she thought it was metal as fuck, though stone did not feel comfortable inviting a being in any part tiger to eat his skin, and consequently the feast was a bit biased, as they tend to be when hosted by stone. Eventually went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go.</p>

		<p>Went to sit kind of with Circe again. Was rather randomly joined by a charming dove-deer by the name of Alchemilla. They, being a they like the feral mule deer he still missed, immediately appealed to him after a sniff or two, and he sat with them for some time.</p>
		
		<p>After Circe was joined by Ronra, he felt like having a nice Birch grass sit, and invited Alchemilla&mdash;Millie&mdash;along, delighted when they accepted. They nested into some grass and some time later, to stone's chagrin, it began to snow. Millie took their leave eventually, and stone fled to the Playground not long afterward to hide beneath the leaning rock from the cold.</p>

		<p>After napping with Stria, noticed Yasu in the distance. She came to say hello before he could make his way to her, and it fully clicked who she was. "You've grown." Yes she has, stone. Yes she has. Had a sweet moment before she joined them in sitting. Shortly after, they were joined by Nélida as well. Despite being thrilled with having a herd, stone was inexplicably apprehensive the entire time, often standing and pacing, seemingly anticipating something which even evaded Hum's awareness.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually, a small blue doe showed up. Her name was Kaoori and she was adorable. Stone took to her immediately in a way that was even mostly IC. She, Stria, and stone had a bit of zoomies, then a plop until Talla arrived to greet Kaoori as well. Charmingly, Talla made a slight mistake and embarrassed herself; less ideally, her embarrassment was too great and she fled into the First Forest to try to live it down. Stone and Kaoori were confused, with stone having not even noticed a blunder, and all they could focus on was the lingering Greitai at the Playground.</p>
		
		<p>Stone got to his hooves, debating going to Talla to check on her. Seeing Greitai move and sensing their Pictograms overlapping made his mind up for him, and he sprinted to her. Having noticed Circe and Ronra earlier as he passed them, he considered for a moment asking for their help, before concluding it would be too complicated, and he wasn't even sure they'd agree. Still, it showed he'd come to accept them well enough to consider it. Passed Greitai by the Ruins, who was on his way back where he'd come from. Trusted Nélida and Kaoori would be safe in the company of the large Yasu and even larger Stria, continuing to Talla who was, fortunately, unharmed. Stood watch.</p>
		
		<p>Caught on that now Grei's pictogram overlapped his group and went sprinting back, discovering her and Sky-Sight in some sort of engagement near the bewildered herd; even Stria stood to watch. Waited for them to recede, urged Kaoori back into the group, and sprinted back to Talla. Fortunately, Greitai was preoccupied with Sky-Sight, and after some time of hard staring toward where he knew she was, he was able to invite Talla to come sit with the group, which to stone's relief she graciously agreed. Led the way.</p>
		
		<p>Talla, looking not at all comfortable with the group on the whole, took Kaoori's side, Stria back to sleep beside Nélida and Yasu. Stone could not bring himself to sit but to set example, instead electing to stand and face head on where he sensed Greitai's Pictogram for a very long time, moving only to track her as she moved through the Forest, keeping himself between her and the herd at all times. Eventually, Kao said goodbye and went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go. Talla, still visibly apprehensive, gave a polite but quick bow and made her way to Ronra and Circe, leaving stone feeling relief that she would not be alone.</p>

		<p>Finally assured enough to settle, he sat at Stria's side, still facing Greitai's all too familiar pictogram. Waiting. After a long while of nothing, he rested, mentally exhausted from the expenditure, but relieved nothing had really happened this time.</p>
		
		<p>Yasu left for Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go. Momentarily joined by a fawn with whom he frolicked for a time, then settled again, the fawn eventually electing to settle with him for a while. Nélida was eventually just not there, stone too tired to notice her departure. Though he relished the company of a herd, he found relief in his only remaining "charge" being so much more capable even than he, and fully settled into resting.</p>

		<p>Saw Ruun again for a moment. Seems like a friend. <strike>Hum fiddled around with a red-green colourblindness simulator and got to explore The Forest somewhat closer to as stone sees. Super cool!!!</strike></p>
		
		<p>Waited until Stria was a bit more lion-free. Ran to sit with her a long while as soon as she was. Had some very nice chuffs.</p>
		
		<p>Noticed Eventide near the Pond. Despite not being close to him, had always been distantly fond of him, and elected to ask Stria if she would be up for moving to go greet the stag. Fortunately, she permitted the effort, and this turned into a playful less-than-direct jaunt over first to drink and play in the water, then sit near Eventide. Moved away to a sunspot to nap when he went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go not long afterward.</p>

		<p>Sensed Stria and came running, though found Róta entirely too intimidating and kept his distance in a bush.</p>
		
		<p>Must have dozed off, because on lifting his head he found himself greeted by red. Though, not The Red. No, this was another red hart. He looked noticeably different, but stone couldn't seem to put his hoof on it, and decided it must be fine. Discovered this deer to be named Ruun. Was almost immediately invited to a run, by Ruun. I mean, who was he to decline?</p>
		
		<p>Having quite literally witnessed the Ruun put into "Ruuning", they retired to a patch of grass somewhat near Stria and Róta where stone felt comfortable grazing somewhat between them both, eventually settling to chew his cud and doze.</p>

		<p>Sat alone in some Birch grass a while. Sat alone in a First Forest sunspot for a while. Caved and went to sit with Circe and Ronra because kinda scary tiger-hybrids and lion-hybrids with whom he shared a mutual friend was better than more sitting alone.</p>
		
		<p>Noticed some time after a doe situated in a patch of purple flowers nearby. Hurried immediately to sit nearby her as to assess her interest, and was thrilled when she stood right away. Sniffs were exchanged, half-nods had, and it seemed that she invited him to sit with her, so he did.</p>
		
		<p>Not many minutes afterward, he stood again to graze nearby, as it seemed the perfect opportunity with a sentry. <strike>Hum has very graceless fingers and accidentally made him rear up, panicked because they didn't want him looking rude, and decided to roll with it as a playful action.</strike> A fantastic romp through the flower patch and weaving between a couple trees nearby was had, more sniffs, and more sits.

Basked with her in a blissful silence in a sunspot by the Pond.</p>
		
		<p>Was beyond overjoyed when the reunion was joined by the little fawn, Murph, who crawled unceremoniously between them as if the two of them had come together exclusively to make for her the most comfortable nest. Though perhaps not initially intended, nothing could have felt more natural, and stone had all but decided then and there that he was, indeed, her dad now.</p>

Having been suffering from what I can only describe as Dad Vibes™️ for the past week or so, immediately scurried to his hooves and went to sit near the fawn.</p>

		<p>Awoke in the blue bowl and knew Nélida and Ross were hanging out at the Pond, so it was extra the place to be. Plopped for a while.</p>
		
		<p>After some browsing on the most delicious possible water plants and some elegant cud chewing, dozed off a bit. Awoke, stretched, and noticed with growing alarm there was a new group member! Moved back with a start as Mischief stood to politely bow like a normal Forest denizen. Stone, meanwhile, having not met any sort of kirin, remained undecided on how he felt, and bore his side. Upon seeing Mis gracefully enter the water, decided that was definitely <i>too</i> weird and retreated further up the shore. After all, he'd spent over nine years on floating islands of grass&mdash;water was his comfort, his retreat. What on earth was a creature doing just, wading fully into it, past even their face.</p>
		
		<p>Stared warily for some time after Mis moved off, clearly too polite to want to bother the frankly over-cautious old stag, not that stone thought of it that way. <strike>Stone, you're sitting with Ross. You're gonna have to get used to weird.</strike> Eventually decided he was not in imminent danger and moved again to sit with Nélida.</p>
		
		<p>And then Kauna showed up and I swear I've about never felt him more thrilled this year. Gracious me, he was up in a flash as she was settling down politely assuming he might simply not notice her <strike>like someone</strike>. She was back up in a moment and he took a second to determine how well she might remember him before he absolutely mashed his face into her from the joy of it all. Fortunately, she seemed relatively equally happy to see him, though he still opted instead for well-timed dual sniffs, a bit of back-grooming, and a nuzzle or three.</p>
		
		<p>Then he just sort of glowed to himself over it for a while. Despite not being the closest friends in the past, she was part of a herd he'd not yet seen much trace of now, and seeing her gave him some hope that he'd not wanted to let come to light if it was just going to end up being painful. He still won't ask about the rest. He will never ask about the rest. "Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to."</p>
		
		<p>Ross invited Mischief back, and stone warily watched the exchange, trying at once to guard Kauna and not put his hoof in his mouth by looking like a bossy old man. Witnessed a clearly favoured exchange and, though not fully certain about Ross himself either, concluded Mis must at least most likely not be an imminent threat. Took Kauna's side under a willow while Ross and Mis sat off to the side. Ross eventually went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go, but having seen nothing terrible happen as of yet, elected simply to remain where he was.</p>
		
		<p>Was visited by a delightful little bird who got strangely close to his face. Trying to get a better view, thought it looked almost&hellip; Transparent? With the thought, it splashed on his face, made of water and nothing else. Would be lying if he said it didn't give him a startle.</p>
		
		<p>Ears pinned and wary, trying to figure out what happened, he came to eye the water-scale-deer-creature. The kirin. Concluding he was making entirely too much of an effort at looking blissfully unaware, he was at once slightly offended, and relieved. A threat does not play practical jokes. Settled a little easier after that, not caring to follow it up with questions or retribution. Still on the fence about this whole "kirin" business, but he seemed to be alright.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually, Kauna too went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go. Dealt with that as best as one can, by immediately resuming the side of Nélida <strike>totally didn't just leave you in the cold for a few hours</strike> and sleeping like his life depended on it. Eventually, receded to The Dark Place himself.</p>

		<p>Then was wandering to Stria when he noticed, got distracted by two pretty deer and was kinda trying to be impressive, then noticed Yasu approaching. Especially after smelling her, knew he knows her somehow, but couldn't quite place how. Still knew she's good and friend, so after some awkward hops from him, tried to convey 'hello I like you.' Ended up just being weird, but at least he was true to his real self.</p>
		
		<p>Went to join Stria, who was sleep on Ronra. Is okay with Ronra even though she's kinda lion, because he doesn't make any sense. Plopped near them, chewed some cud, fell asleep.</p>
		
		<p>Woke up to Kerosene come to say hello. DEFINITELY remembered them, they are warm! <strike>Stone you selfish prick.</strike> Was very excited about this, had some zoomies, did a plop after they did. Fell asleep more.</p>

		<p>Awoke and lounged around. Sensed a lone female (Sauvignon) and had to go try to flirt. Sat near-ish to her for some time after being acknowledged; didn't understand that she was (obviously, tbh) not in a social mood. Was joined by Elliot and sat with him after failing to rile him into play. <strike>Why would you try you noodle.</strike> Fell asleep at his side after warming up, awakening not long after Elliot departed for the Pond to find himself covered in a blanket. Proceeded to flip his Goddamn shit over having a blanket, immediately dropping it no fewer than four times and getting it really fucking dirty. Dragged it around in his mouth until he figured out how to kind of hang it on his back. Was approached by what looked like a goat (Aileana), if he knew what a goat was. Acknowledged her but was really too distracted by the blanket to be a deer. At almost the same time, Kerosene and Mjölnir approached from behind and were doing something, maybe talking. Stone made a note to greet Kero but was just too overwhelmed to right then. Too much blanket. Noticed Stria and sprinted toward her to show her the blanket, but had to double back several times to pick up the blanket because it kept flying off of him. Was too stupid to just hang onto it the whole time, so it took a while.</p>
		
		<p>Got to Stria and noticed her standing over a resting Alika. Remembered seeing the fawn&mdash;well, she was a fawn then&mdash;once or twice, and seeing Stria look after her once before. Had been vaguely annoyed by her then but couldn't recall why. Looking upon her now, felt immediate concern and lowered the blanket onto her, leaving it in her care for the time being (as I don't even inform the player of this lmao, I'm an asshole; if you even see this you can ignore it or use it do what you will). Stria nibbled at the blanket but stone conveyed that it did not really taste like food, because he had tried. After greeting Stria a little, ran around like a noodle some more because he had the inkling to. Tried to go visit Kero but they were preoccupied with Mjol. Gave up after the whole thing went straight over his head and returned to Stria, noodling more, her watching detachedly but with amusement and perhaps even some sense of peace. Kerosene came over and, after greeting stone, immediately went to Alika, getting all up in Stria's space. Stria left without responding, looking upset. Stone followed after a bit more frolicking, his manner subdued in obliged sympathy. They groomed and rested against one another for a bit. Then the server had a shitfit and I finally went to fucking bed so stone, like, vanished or some shit. I'm sure Stria's chill with it. The Dark Place: Expedited Edition.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Blue Bowl. Hung out for a while. Went to the Pond for a drink. Was going to wander to the thickets near De Drinkplaats to bed down for warmth when he sensed Kerosene and Yasuko. Made his way to them, noting Thais and&mdash;apparently&mdash;one of her offspring, nearby. Kind of frowned at them but there was enough distance for him not to strictly mind. Nudged at Kero in greeting after being nudged at himself. Was politely assaulted by fawn sniffer, had his legs bumped some. Parent and child settled but stone did not, feeling neither comfortable nor apprehensive about any particular thing. Stayed standing for some time, essentially nothing happening, before he settled near Kerosene to leech their warmth.</p>
		
		<p>Just as he sat, Draven showed up and greeted his family. Despite his bitterness toward Thais (oh my God it was one action you saw in passing you fuck), felt warmed by the familial bonds he witnessed. Also Kerosene. Really primarily Kerosene, but it was cute nonetheless.</p>
		
		<p>Sat with them until he was well and warm. Caught the scent of a lone being nearby (username orbit) and couldn't help but at least go to see if they'd respond to him, under the impression they were a cute lady. Stood around trying to show himself off. Another individual came by and appeared to be waiting for their attention too. They eventually made their way right up to "orbit", which got them to stand and respond. They left, however, so stone took the chance to lek about like a moron. Garnering a nod from them, he took that as permission to stay. He strutted around some, stood "watch," and just generally tried to appear polite but manly for them. They eventually sat, and he moved to higher ground to stand watch some more. (Never have I seen some fuckboi go so out of his way for a nod, but this asshat, he's determined you see.)</p>
		
		<p>When nothing appeared to be happening (still) and his legs got tired, he sat down in some grass nearby. To his delight, they moved closer. Deciding not to push it (yet, you fuck), he simply settled where he was and nibbled at the grasses, trying to look nonchalant.</p>
		
		<p>Then the other (pictogram not showing up on map ): ) came and sat with them and stone just frowned to himself. (And I had to drive somewhere and became boring.)</p>
		
		<p>(Player was amazed to discover "orbit" still there when it returned.) Suddenly became active again after <em>inexplicably</em> zoning out for a long while. Found himself alone with "orbit" again. Got to his hooves and made a <strike>fool</strike> show of himself, in case they were paying any attention. In the process, completely missed Kero in the distance valiantly defending Thais's and their own family from a peryton. (He's such a good friend.) Eventually gave up trying to impress them; inched closer to them and sat back down.</p>
		
		<p>Ended up nodding off <strike>because someone got distracted cleaning hand-me-down jewelry</strike> and awoke to find himself somewhat snugged up to "orbit." Lifted his head and tentatively positioned himself to lightly groom at their shoulder. <strike>So suave.</strike> They sat a while, then he fell asleep and went off to The Dark Place <strike>because Hums have to go to sleep before they go to work</strike>.</p>

		<p>Hung out with Stria all day. Alain was there at first, there was a feral red doe (nicknamed Jossukka). Jyoti came and sat and just stayed and made Stria anxious which was annoying. Stria eventually moved, stone followed. So did Jyoti. Jyoti eventually approached, which got stone standing to indicate maybe he ought to fuck off instead. The Firefly asked Stria to talk, they did, stone weighed in once to Jyoti's benefit but not out of any favour to him. It ended with Stria letting Jyoti try to win her back over over time, and him settling somewhere nearby while stone continued eating (look waiting out a conversation is boring okay) then chewed his cud at Stria's side, not giving her <em>any</em> Goddamn space because she was warm and put up with him.</p>
		
		<p>Stria went away eventually. Stone went looking for new faces, didn't find anyone he liked the looks of alone, instead sensed Kero's kid that he'd met the day before who was conveniently with her mom (Cassiopeia) and adopted sibling (Alika) in the Blue Bowl. Went there, plopped down and ate some more. Was joined by Yasu who he tried to get to play after her mother left, but she was tired. Settled again near her and just chilled. Rested some in the foliage, chewed his cud, did deer stuff. She made off when he wasn't paying attention or he would have made an effort to keep an eye on her for Kero. Whoops. Ah well. Rested some more. Went off to The Dark Place eventually.</p>

		<p>Awoke from a dead sleep. Immediately sensed that quite a bit of time had passed. He'd been letting this happen more and more often. His antlers had not only fallen but were well into re-growth. His coat had darkened to fit the cooler season. The scent of rut was in the air. Regret swam at the back of his mind, but his absence had become so habitual that he couldn't feel right pitying himself for it. He was just asleep. He thought of his dreams in The Dark Place. He looked around. Of course he stayed asleep. It was easier.</p>
		
		<p>Not immediately recognizing anyone, feeling disoriented, he sat himself down and collected himself. Like he used to do, though he'd moved away from it, he built a cairn to keep himself busy.</p>
		
		<p>Kerosene showed up not long after. Evidently he'd just forgotten what others' names felt like, for the time being. He didn't mind. He didn't want to be here, awake, but also felt poorly considering leaving. Really, he was just waiting for enough to happen for him to not feel guilty going back to being asleep. Stone sniffed at them but couldn't even fully recall the complete extent of their relationship, so sort of just let whatever happen. Thankfully, all Kerosene did was sit down, which stone was more than happy to join in. Stone felt he ought to speak, but did not.</p>
		
		<p>Kerosene's daughter, Yasu, came to join them. Stone sniffed but did not pick up on the relation immediately, due to lack of usual scent cues. Gradually he inferred the relation, and felt mild surprise. Though he knew remarkably little about Kerosene, he'd never expected them to reproduce. He was pleased with this. Yasu appeared polite and quiet, which was just the sort of fawn he most liked. She nestled at Kero's side, and stone returned to sitting down. He built another cairn.</p>
		
		<p>Recognized Brent who rested nearby. Remembered him being trouble, and large. Didn't really care, though. What reason did he have to make a bother of himself? Stone doubted anything would happen, and was just too "meh" to care.</p>
		
		<p>Kinda started to go on a walk, but no one really popped out at him to try to interact with. Ended up returning to Kero and Yasu. Laid his head on the ground and sighed not unlike a dog who has clearly had a ruff day at the office.</p>
		
		<p>Ended up falling asleep and returning to The Dark Place.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest. Sensed Rhona and went to peek at her, but she was sleepin'. Instead, stood awkwardly by the group nearby (Farrel, Kaya, Ziara, Rajani) because he was more-or-less okay with all of them (shocking). Farrel (I think??) came to greet him with a sniff and returned, but he didn't want to venture closer until being "approved" by all of them, so he grazed non-threateningly nearby. Rajani ended up kind of staring him down so he tried to clarify his intentions through body language <strike>which no one knows you idiot</strike>. Greitai crested the horizon nearby and he decided the possibility of being incorporated into this group wasn't worth having her attention. He moved back to Rhona and stood watch to keep Red's daughter as safe as he could. Rhona awoke as Greitai moved away, having apparently greeted a friend in the group.</p>
		
		<p>Stone was delighted to see Rhona, but without a buffer, his awkwardness in their developing relationship came through. Socially, he couldn't interact with her the same way he'd interact with any other doe; however, he didn't know her well enough for her to fall into the "family" category he'd designated her as by being The Red's child. Stone became distracted because there were butterflies and he is three. Then he plopped down in a sun spot a bit away, and she got up from her normal spot to join him, which was reassuring.</p>
		
		<p>He sensed Stria not long afterward and bolted to her. He ran around her excitedly, did the shakes, was generally a goober. He led her back to Rhona, but went "too fast" so they ended up yelling at each other. When they reached Rhona, she misunderstood at first and was spooked, but it devolved into a session of play (that lasted like an hour my God, it was great) centered primarily on butt-nuzzles/sniffin'/bumpin'/etc b/c weak spot lmao. There's no way to really articulate what went down but it was good for stone to get that out of him and bond to Rhona more, and for Stria to actually move for once (and I'm sure Rhona too but lol).</p>
		
		<p>Stone sensed Saosin far away and wanted to say hi, but the play was so play. The same happened with Talla basically the entire time, and muley when he scented them. Muley, luckily, made their way to the group just as Rhona defeated Stria and smooshed her. Stone tried to convey that they needed help to smoosh Stria but there is only so much foolishness a feral deer will put up with. Stone did get up to groom the mule deer in an effort to be more refined, though admittedly there is no saving a silly-no-pants.</p>
		
		<p>He rejoined the Stria/Rhona pile and nodded off for a time. Eventually, the mule deer got to their hooves and this stirred him. He joined them in going to check on Talla, and after greeting her as well as one can from a great distance, stone ate for a time and otherwise stood around, feeling worried for her but otherwise dandy.</p>
		
		<p>He noticed Stria had woken up so went back to the pile, and was surprised when both muley and Talla followed him. Conveniently, he laid on Stria when he returned, rendering her clearly incapable definitely of getting up and making Talla more uncomfortable. Muley rested again, but Talla never sat, looking visibly apprehensive the whole time. This went on for a bit.</p>
		
		<p>A random swooped by and he got pelt spelled, was a grump. Washed it off. Got pelt spelled again, grumped at the speller. Washed it off. The random had spooked off muley, then Talla went off on her own again; stone checked on them both on his way back, but they seemed settled, so he just returned to Stria and Rhona, feeling vulnerable and insufficient. He stood guard due to their diminished presence. Stria took this as cause to get to her hooves, albeit extremely slowly. About the time she managed to do so, Elliot turned up. Poor Elliot had never seen stone in proper health, and after being forced to be stagnant for so long stone had&mdash;at least for now&mdash;become more energetic than he'd ever been. After they were all standing, stone sprinted toward the feral mule deer, turning and running circles impatiently while waiting for them to move at a more reasonable speed after him. They met the mule in a thicket of blueberries where they were bedded down, and though stone tried at first to sit (Elliot had already begun to feed), Stria refused, looking grumpy about having been roused for apparently nothing. Stone got back to his hooves and harassed her some more, and muley and Rhona ended up joining. Elliot watched because Elliot doesn't run and have very important eating to do.</p>
		
		<p>Muley "stole" Rhona so Stria got pissy, again, and broke that up. Then Stria and stone ended up fighting, which they'd done earlier but they did better. Stria tried to plead for him to give her the win but he wouldn't hear it, though honestly she grew more intimidating each time and he doubted he could continue this for much more of her life with any degree of believability. He paused to indicate to her that "her girl" was gone and, indeed, Rhona had gone off to greet a newcomer&mdash;Lucem. Stria was ticked until she realized Rhona was coming back with another girl. Everyone sniffed, more play was had. Muley got stone which endlessly surprised him. Stone licked his wounds from play-fighting Stria; she attempted to hide from him the fact that she had pulled something. They both retained about the same level of maturity.</p>
		
		<p>After hearing a spell in the distance which gave him pause, stone found himself apprehensive and stood for a time looking and listening and sensing and smelling about. Greitai was still some distance away. Nothing else stood out to him. He eventually largely dismissed it when the mule deer seemed to express curious concern, but remained feeling odd. Stria and Rhona had one last hurrah after Stria took offense to Rhona rather saucily eating blueberries, which Stria naturally wanted. They ended up settling together to competitively eat, muley bedded down in their thicket again, Lucem and settled at the base of a tree more than a polite distance away, and Elliot had never stopped feeding. Stone stood watch for a little while, but decided nothing would come by that they couldn't handle as a group and finally sat down to feed and ruminate after expending all of that energy. He napped on and off and generally recovered from being a dingus.</p>
		
		<p>When he lifted his head to check on things, he noticed muley grooming the feral sambar past the group, and hurried over immediately. They had a heartfelt groom if ever there was one before stone returned to his "post," the feral pair picking up feeding on grasses around the area. Stone remained standing so that they might feel at ease knowing they had a sentry <strike>even though his player was writing updates and therefore not even looking</strike>.</p>
		
		<p>Muley and the sambar ended up sort of oozing away as they fed, so stone went back and sat near Stria and Rhona b/c Stria is a priority no matter how much he loves his other friends. (Also I'm just too lazy to keep up with them rn lmao.) Elliot made his way over to stone and finally sat down. Stone continued to keep an eye on the ferals as best as he could because he's a nervous wreck. He noticed them playing and that reassured him that they would be okay.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually they came back and that put his mind at ease. He realized as they sat together that he was, indeed, fundamentally different than them. Definitely no longer just "a deer," though he did not fully embrace it. They were closer than he could ever be, purer he felt than he would be again. They were important simply because of their simplicity and honesty. To wrong them was worse than to wrong him because they could not understand what he did, and because of that he had a responsibility to them. However, because of their fundamental differences, he could never mean to them what they meant to each other, if they understood that he was different, and he sensed they did. This saddened him, but perhaps it was best. They had each other, and for them, he thought that may be better than just having him. Still, he found himself envious, and sat in a heap to himself pouting because he's real mature.</p>
		
		<p>Then a fawn showed up and everything kind of just exploded. Two adults showed up as the fawn was still concerning the mule and sambar, and they did not help. The two ferals fled entirely, and when stone got back from trying to help, Stria had vanished as well (Rhona had left some time earlier so subtly stone didn't noticed; not like he could see her earlier over the mountain that was Stria). However, The Red had emerged from wherever he got off to, so at least there was that. So stone, Elliot, The Red, and the fawn sat together. The ferals did eventually regroup.</p>
		
		<p>Honestly not sure if they players who spawned the next series of events were trolls intentionally, but it seemed like it. Two players (one username hunta) came through and frightened the ferals away. Stone, The Red, muley, and the sambar regrouped. They rushed again, same effect. All four plus Elliot regrouped on Red Hill. Finally noticed something was wrong with The Red when Elliot was doing weird elf magic on him. He smelled wrong. He was sick.</p>
		
		<p>Before stone had time to act on his realization, the pair rushed again. Basically this kept happening and no amount of taunting or antlering put them off so stone decided instead to actively do nothing at them. So, next time they came around, he faced them and stared, and didn't do anything else. When they moved, he followed, and stared. Finally, a long damn time later when one had vanished and the other grouped with new friends, stone gave up and returned to his group. He took a rest first, because he desperately needed it. Limbs twitching, he basically dropped to the ground, but watched. About this time there was some sort of unspoken agreement to pay them less regard.</p>
		
		<p>Perhaps this had attracted attention, perhaps it was chance, but either way, Adelaide was next to storm through. Thankfully, Rossamund (who stone had exceedingly briefly greeted while staring at the probably-trolls) had just joined the group, and took to fending her off right away. Eventually she stopped coming back and the ferals returned. Stone groomed The Red in concern then sat down. Ross groomed stone's head which was fine, they were friends now. (U defend my friends we bros 4 lyf.) He then groomed Red. Then he left. Stone checked on sambar and mule, who were obviously stressed and exhausted. He couldn't help that much so he just settled near them to rest himself more. Later he moved more toward the center of the group. The Red slept. Stone, completely exhausted, couldn't help but sleep as well. As much as he wanted to keep watch, he returned to The Dark Place.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest. (Had been around some since last entry, but nothing interesting enough to log happened, so skip forward to today.) Immediately sought out "lonely" cervids, finding Lavinia quite quickly. Set about impressing her, but was almost instantly distracted by another being (username deerkey). Things started off as they usually do, sniffing, being stared at, trying to ignore the perceived challenge politely. The stranger didn't take kindly to stone's attempt at politeness&mdash;in his own culture&mdash;and taunted. Stone backed up as he often does when faced with aggression, and the stranger took this as an invitation to&hellip; Battle? Stone walked, then ran, brief paces away, while being pursued. He moved to the Pond where he gave up retreating and simply stood while the stranger eloquently yelled in his face. Seeing that he was no longer participating, the stranger moved on.</p>
		
		<p>Returned to Lavinia who had not moved. Set about "wooing" her by charmingly sitting down. Then sitting closer. And closer. She profoundly didn't seem to give a shit (player AFK? mystery). He finally sniffed and still, no luck. By this time, Akan was lingering on the periphery <strike>again</strike>. Stone wondered if he'd make a nuisance of himself, but for coming by too close once, he kept his distance.</p>
		
		<p>Took time to actually observe the group who was right nearby at the Crying Idol. Was a little surprised to see Shahla (you didn't smell them? ok guess u were RLY distracted A+ prey animal there buddy). Kio and one of their offspring were present as well, but they were piled so closely that it was difficult to discern anyone else there. They were all keeping to themselves and, by this point, stone liked to believe they were rather amiable toward one another&mdash;the relationship equivalent to a polite smile when you pass someone in a hallway.</p>
		
		<p>Remembered seeing the lovely scaled-horned-hoofed being (Muirne) near the Pond earlier when he'd been wandering back to Lavinia. She'd been with company but he sensed that now she was only with a tiny winged fawn (Maaravi/Arnljotr/Ailbhe). Elected to see how open she was to his company, since Lavinia currently seemed indifferent.</p>
		
		<p>Upon closing the distance, he wondered if perhaps the fawn might be hers. Considering the wings, he didn't believe so, but if he'd learned anything from this place it was that he could never predict what strange beings he would come across, so he did not dismiss the possibility. Worried he may seem pushy or threatening, he left a wide berth between himself and the pair and idly chewed some grass while he waited to be noticed.</p>
		
		<p>After some time, decided they might not want to be disturbed, and moved off to look for a new <strike>victim</strike> possible friend. Approached Isiel, vaguely recalling seeing her around the rut the previous year. Smelled her company on her, recognizing that they were not his... Usual sort. Ah well, he couldn't afford to be picky here, and she seemed nice enough at a glance. Again, he tried his luck with sitting and trying to appear both nonthreatening and interesting.</p>
		
		<p>Got bored of sitting and paced the area grazing; settled again to ruminate. Started to acknowledge that he wasn't having much luck with this today, as he'd had in previous days. (Trying to expand his friend circle is like pulling teeth b/c I'm too much of a dingus to speak outside of TEF lmao. So here we are, sitting, hoping, because I'm a fucking noodle. W/e tho it's like a sport.) Kind of gave up on waiting for her to acknowledge him, while also not bothering to move because no one else stood out to him. Built some little cairns out of pebbles hidden in the grass. He hadn't <em>entirely</em> given that up!</p>
		
		<p>When even cairn-building bored him, he searched again for possible company, and decided to try the nearby Isabeau. Because it had proved so successful thus far, again he tried his "sit down and look coolly disinterested but also curious" method. Again, she smelled of interesting company, and her feathers were very&hellip; Dramatic. But maybe she'd surprise him, be more of a deer than anyone else around today. He ambled closer. Gaining ground, he noticed some healing wounds to her, rather grievous in nature. He was more impressed than anything, as anyone ought to be when faced with a severely wounded being who yet walks. He could respect that. He wondered what had happened.</p>
		
		<p>Approached by a <strike>smol bun</strike> rabbit (Saro), he stuck his neck out to sniff at her but didn't move much so as not to startle. Then a fawn came by who he stood to greet. When Isabeau stood, he sat so as not to seem desperate or overbearing. She observed for a moment and&hellip; Booked it. He watched her leave, neither surprised nor disappointed, honestly fairly amused with the turn of events. The fawn followed, yelling after her. This left stone with the rabbit.</p>
		
		<p>They kind of stared at one another before stone set his head on the ground with a settling sigh. Right as she was thinking to herself that he was alright, he pooped. Not long after, she booped his nose and ran off to join a friend. He continued to sit for a moment before calling the quest for new friends quits and moving back toward Muirne and Maaravi regardless of whether they acknowledged him. He sat in the sun patch he'd sat in earlier and rested, nudging stones around with his snout but not doing anything else. As he had around her previously, stone fell asleep. He returned to The Dark Place sometime afterward without rousing.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest. Continued loafing about near the stream where he awoke until he notice Akan nearby, staring. Got to his hooves and moved on because, though still not intimidating, Akan wasn't someone he wanted to deal with. Moved away, pausing a moment to face him like, "what?" Passed several beings and eventually settled in a patch of blueberries to graze. Moved on not long after, not in the mood to sit and ruminate.</p>
		
		<p>Sensed and scented for lone beings&mdash;particularly ladies, as he had been on and off for a few days (stone you're not even in rut anymore with the event you literally get like five months oh my GOD you WHORE; maybe if you'd been bred since you came here this wouldn't be a problem). Felt two, but one seemed more open to him upon <strike>totally not creepily</strike> scoping them out (STONE HER BIO SAYS SHE'S NOT EVEN A YEAR OLD IDC IF HER BIO ART SEEMS ADULT WESTERN RPers WILL NEVER BE DOWN WITH THIS). He'd only just started awkwardly standing around Rajani when who comes cresting over a hill but Akan, with his friend Brent in tow. There goes the neighbourhood.</p>
		
		<p>Resigned himself to dealing with a rowdy delinquent and likely equally delinquent giant. Like he'd felt long ago, wasn't really intimidated. The vibe wasn't violent&mdash;just challenging in a very "buck" kind of way, even though neither of them really fit the category. Some staring, snorting, sniffing, shoving, and just general, "You wanna go? Let's go."s were had. Akan seemed equally uncertain and exhilarated; Brent seemed bored. Brent left first, and then Akan&mdash;with a "sore loser huff"&mdash;followed. But stopped. At Rajani. Stone kind of just pokerface'd and waited, but one of her friends showed up before Akan left, and so stone acknowledged the lost opportunity and tried to get the attention of the other loner.</p>
		
		<p>He made his way to the Blue Bowl but, though he sensed someone nearby, Galene was nowhere to be seen (lmao in a tree). He stood around hoping to draw attention to himself, but it's not like an old deer just standing in a field of blueberries is really all that alluring. He moved off in search of someone else to meet, spying on groups from a distance in hopes that he might be welcomed into one of the established circles, but he had no such luck with the little effort he put in and eventually moved to a patch of grasses near the Crying Idol&mdash;the one he'd come to consider his favourite during previous ruts&mdash;and finally got around to ruminating.</p>
		
		<p>He was approached by a strange being (Jacinth) who seemed quite amiable but he found rather intimidating. (After 
		
		<p>As he ruminated, beings came and went, and he sensed new lone strangers. He immediately sought out a being near the Pond/Twin Gods (Muirne), who seemed like she would be much&hellip; Larger than she was when he came within sight of her. However, she was lovely&mdash;some sort of horned and scaled hoofed beast with a long and flowing tail, for whom he felt immediate interest. He sat in a sunspot and grazed absently at some plants which didn't have a pleasant texture or taste but looked nice, then moved to nibble at a sapling, then itched against a tree&hellip; She did not seem invested. He settled back into the sunspot. When he looked back, she seemed slightly closer? So he moved closer. Then he was <em>sure</em> she'd moved so he moved a lot. He managed to doze off while trying to look really casual (too casual oh my God) and when he awoke she was right next to him. Not really a proper introduction but he was down with it.</p>
		
		<p>Fell asleep again and slept for a <em>really long time</em> (my mom called and we hadn't talked in a long time so we chatted for over an hour LOL). Awoke to find himself alone. Ah well, she'd be a face to look out for in the future. Hopefully he'd made for at least comforting company, albeit boring.</p>
		
		<p>Moved to the Crying Idol to have a little bath. Noticed Akan resting beside someone and went to stand by creepily, but had not noticed Brent basically following him. Turned it instead into a totally still ominous not surprised at all circle before moving away. Stood for some time, wondering what to do. A strange-looking being (Bijoux) sat at a tree near him and he decide simply to wonder away from the various odd-looking strangers. He passed a few beings but none suited his very particular preferences, so he decided in the end just to sit on Red Hill.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest. Goofed around some because no one around seemed all that active and he didn't initially recognize anyone. Eventually came across a resting Suavis and settled near her <strike>because she is so cute</strike> in an effort to befriend her so that when he and Stria encountered her together, she might be more open to them. Grazed for a bit, returned to her. She roused and scooted closer to him. He scooted back in an effort to lure her forward more, but they both dozed off before a game could be made out of it. He returned to The Dark Place, boring and old.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in some blueberries near the Crying Idol. Moved around between sleeping deer, but didn't find anyone he'd like roused. Eventually, sensed the sambar doe!!! Joined her, but she was asleep. Slept a while himself. When he woke, she had moved off with Yumi. Stone stood beside them a long while, then sat. He nodded off again. When he came to, they were both unmoved, so he finally made his way elsewhere. Thankfully, he nearly immediately sensed Stria, and sprinted to her. He went circles around her while she, in an inverse of their initial relationship, sat lazily and waited for him to calm down. He immediately led her to a housecat he'd seen earlier (Suavis) because she was interesting.</p>
		
		<p>After they reached the cat, Stria immediately went from grumpy disinterest to almost-cheerful obsession. The cat needed to be her friend, and it needed to be her friend <em>right now</em>. When Suavis took note of them, she seemed initially apprehensive (and who could blame her, two giants thundering around like she's their size and they've been herd-mates since birth) but gradually grew somewhat tolerant of the two as stone started a game of "sniff cat, run away." Who could forget that old time classic? She remained amazingly tolerant even of this behaviour. Comen and another being came to see what was up, and Suavis seemed to take exception to that. The cat moved off and stone and Stria followed in tow, stone having completely accepted her as a herd member. She was clearly chill, why not. Something about a tiny cat appealed to him in a way he could not articulate. She was just so small and almost completely harmless. He liked her immediately, was even somewhat concerned for her.</p>
		
		<p>When the cat retreated further to the Ruins, stone decided not to follow, and Stria drowned her sorrows in shrubbery. Stone tried to rouse her from sitting and feeding, but she had grown completely inert. Seeing no other choice, he turned to drastic measures. After galloping around in the Pond for a bit because carpe diem, he returned to her with a mouth full of water and haphazardly opened his mouthful of it onto her face. She licked his nose which seemed remarkably accepting of his provocation, and settled in for a nap. He joined her, and soon returned to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, on Red Hill. Moved away toward Sasuda after he got bored, who seemed familiar but he couldn't remember why. He smelled like Kauna enough to be some sort of relative and that was good enough. Sat away from him, however, because he had a fox friend and stone ain't about that life.</p>
		
		<p>Was joined by an exceedingly quiet Kerosene who seemed to have gained some tact in his absence. Happy to see them, stone got up to sniff to check on their well-being, remembering all at once that they didn't seem to work like that and gave few indicators of their mood and health through odour. Endlessly strange.</p>
		
		<p>Got devouted. Is probably most opposed to this pelt spell since it comes from worshipping the gods and someone's bitter. Sat and grumped until it went away by itself. Then got a mask spelled on him. Violently shook it off and continued to grump. Saw the perpetrator go for a third spell and booked it. Watched Kerosene try to explain that their friend didn't appreciate spells. Felt touched, but also confused by the whole "conversation." While more aware, Kero still somewhat bewildered him. The stranger left and stone then went around the Forest sniffin' stuff, learning about things he'd missed. Fights had happened, things were hurt, a shitton of predators were around. Yeah, the Forest hadn't changed. He'd led Kero into the Blue Bowl where he wound up frolicking because he fucking loves the Blue Bowl when he sensed Stria. He raced over to her&mdash;where Kero then took his leave&mdash;but she was too lazy or whatever to stand so stone went and stood on some rocks, yelled because he was up high and there's something about being up high that makes yelling better, then got bored of exploring and went back to Stria. He rushed her a few times trying to get a reaction but then gave up and instead went to go check on Talla.</p>
		
		<p>They had their usual song and dance, stand around looking as harmless as possible, low-key hang out and sit together roughly a galaxy apart, etc. She seemed well, that was good. The day the most cautious deer he knew in the Forest got hurt or killed was the day shit went down.</p>
		
		<p>Fell asleep. Woke up. Moved closer to the shore. Built a cairn. Fell asleep. Woke up again. Riveting stag. Continued the cycle.</p>
		
		<p>Stria came by eventually. They played and then she chased him some and he proved he's still faster than her. She visited Nikhil and Shardul while he rested some, then she led him to some blueberries and they ate together. He fell asleep and returned to The Dark Place curled into her side.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest near Åsleif's birthing site, at first slowly and then all at once. Noticed the colours of the leaves and the scents on the air, the unmistakable warmth. It seemed he'd allowed time to slip by again, unaware in sleep. He'd have Hell to pay with Stria, and perhaps Åsleif, but the others would likely just welcome him almost as if nothing had happened. He didn't scent or sense anyone he knew anyway, so instead he decided simply to wander, ending up at Red Hill as he often did now. There was a sleeping deer who made good company (who, despite appearing as a nameless to me, was actually Ben; ignored this because he wouldn't have approached a stranger who was not nameless so brazenly, and the bean was asleep anyway). Overall, he felt entirely relaxed, still distanced enough from the Forest to feel no fear.</p>
		
		<p>Grooming himself happily, relishing the minimal pain he now experienced with his injuries completely healed, he noticed that he'd become quite red. Indeed, it seemed that a good deal of time had passed for him to be in his summer coat. Sheepishly, he brushed it off. There was nothing he could do about it now. Having grown more and more aware of what he experienced in his time spent in The Dark Place, perhaps simply explaining it to anyone who was upset would appease them. It's not like he was away on purpose, or even knew at the time that he was away for any length of time at all. Surely they dreamed. He comforted himself with these thoughts and simply enjoyed the warmth and the sunlight and the birds singing, not a dream, but real, real and still pleasant. A nice change of pace.</p>
		
		<p>The Red turned up, and stone was too comfortable to think anything of the slightest hints at his disease, assuming&mdash;if anything&mdash;they were merely some trace of a visitor past. They sat together and passed time being old and content with it. Red went off some time later and stone didn't follow.</p>
		
		<p>Stria wandered to him and they bumped one another. She was too depressed (when was she not now?) to seem interested in harassing him for being going however long it had been, and he wasn't about to bring it up, so they just smooshed and sat together. He'd missed how she smelled, even though her scent was often in his dreams.</p>
		
		<p>Dozed off next to her and returned to The Dark Place. Naturally.</p>

		<p>He is "dreaming" in The Dark Place again. He is about two years old and maintaining a harem. Every day they venture down into the phumdis and he bathes in the mud. There are no predators and he has not needed to fight, only to display. His place is not threatened and he is well-regarded by the does. His favourite plants seem to grow everywhere. The rain is warm and the sun is gentle. He's forgotten the Forest again, for now.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch, aware that something was happening. Once he understood, he may have even been a little grateful to the Magic. Maybe.</p>
		
		<p>He stood and had to take some time to reacquaint himself with his body. He was shaky-limed, like a fawn, until he found his bearings. Only then did he risk moving and making a fool of himself.</p>
		
		<p>Joined Åsleif at a tree overlooking the Pond and the Playground, aware she'd entered labour even from a distance, aware of her fear from her scent then her demeanour. They were joined by a crow who seemed pretty crow. She set her blanket upon him to keep it from becoming soiled&mdash;for once, stone was clean, having been in The Dark Place so long that virtually all the dirt and debris had been sloughed off of him. He admired her various scars across her back but it merely confirmed what he already knew&mdash;she was strong.</p>
		
		<p>The birth itself seemed simple, despite her apprehension. He didn't want to be pushy&mdash;particularly since he'd obviously been gone long enough for her to finish her pregnancy and he assumed she'd be peeved with him&mdash;and so he merely watched the fawn from where he sat.</p>
		
		<p>He noticed Red with another nearby&mdash;he'd been there for some time and stone had known but the dots just hadn't connected&mdash;and went to greet him before returning to Åsleif and her fawn (Åsa). He took the risk of sniffing at the fawn and determined that she was definitely female and her coat colour added to stone's suspicion of her relation to The Red. Once her scent came through, he'd know. Still, he was definitely Åsleif's, so there was loyalty there nonetheless. He returned to Åsleif, disappointed that she had done such a thorough job of cleaning the afterbirth. (There's nothing like fresh placenta.) Since she and the fawn were clean, he tried very hard to gently drape her blanket-shawl-poncho over her again, but it kind of just went down in a heap. He looked sheepish and went back to sitting in the greenery at the base of the closest tree, nibbling it as he sat.</p>
		
		<p>Dozed on and off. Kept watch but did a rather shoddy job of it since Red was nearby. (I have work in eight hours and needed to be sleep an hour ago to sleep for eight hours LOL RIP. I selfishly couldn't not let him attend.)</p>
		
		<p>Returned to The Dark Place sometime later. (Dat crash.)</p>

		<p>Reluctant to enter The Endless Forest where he feels pain, stone subconsciously has been keeping himself in The Dark Place. As usual, while there, he's unaware of how much time is passing. It feels just like sleeping&mdash;like dreaming. It could be a few hours, it could be a few days, longer. It feels like only a moment or two. Eventually, through the slow murk of sleep, the thought will surface, the curiosity about loved ones. Eventually.</p>

		<p><em>It is a dream of grasses. He is home, he is young. The grasses reach far above his head, fuzzily merge with the sky. The sun is there, a fuzzy orb, a softly bright spot which spreads through the sky, through the grass, through him. It is so warm. The sweet smell of the grass perfumes the air, the scent of clean soil grounding him, just enough. He is curled and looking up. His mother is grazing nearby, with other does. He is safe. A wind stirs the grasses and he watches clouds pass overhead. He hears the somehow gentle beat of hooves, of large beings nearby. The grasses shift in the wind, and as they dance, he can see H. and Stria at play. Rune is near them, peering at something. The grasses tickle and they whisper as they sway. The mule deer, the sambar, the Formosan doe, and others&mdash;those varied faces who he's met with Red over time&mdash;they graze with his mother. The Red and The Inferno spar, at once in play and with all their might. His heart leaps. He feels pride, but it is a gentle pride, and he is not taken with it. He does not become jealous, nor melancholy. He knows he, too, is strong. Åsleif's blanket is being draped over him; her eyes are smiling. He sees others he knows, other faces through the stalks of grass. They are playing, and grazing, and resting; everything is right. He looks back up to the sky. The grass is so tall, the sky is so vast, but they welcome him. They embrace him like a womb. He is warm. He is safe.</em></p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Moved off to the Blue Bowl for warmth and to feed. Grazed, ruminated, and rested for the better part of a day to himself. Moved away after sleeping for some time, a bit unnerved by the very red Lieva who was nearby. He was having trouble sensing others in the thick of Pictograms that clouded his senses. He felt Ross, but no one else, even though he was sure he knew others around. Decided he'd go to see what Rossamund was doing, even though he seemed to be with a group including Nikhil&mdash;perhaps from a distance. Passed Sabel on the way, and had to pause to admire her. She had a touch of something familiar and friendly, something stone liked. But she seemed to be going somewhere, and who was an old stag like stone to hold her up? He had to stop to rest anyway. He got distracted building a cairn and when he looked up, Kerosene was greeting Sabel. Apparently, they knew one another. (Of all the possibilities.) Stone sniffed at Sabel, then at Kerosene, who sat down not long after. Stone followed, then Sabel. Stone got up again to graze (what a fat). Stone sat back down. He was generally boring company.</p>
		
		<p>He went to go beat up on a tree and some bushes to start yet another scrape. GOTTA GET UR SCENT OUT THERE, U FEEL. MAY BE LADIES. And then he sat back down and olded some more.</p>
		
		<p>Kerosene stood and started walking, Sabel following. Stone at first didn't plan to follow, but they were moving so slowly that he found the company irresistible. So he did. Kerosene led them at first over to the group Rossamund was in, then over to a group with some feathered deer, then he just seemed utterly bewildered. Eventually he led them across the entire Forest, past the Pond where stone stopped to gnaw on some willow bark, over the bridge, to the Blue Bowl. He seemed disappointed to find Draven asleep (Thais and The Collector in tow). He turned and led the group back to essentially where they'd started and stone settled in some grasses for a long rest, the few rests he'd taken on the way having only barely gotten him through. Akan, however, took interest in them, so stone had to rise again to watch him. Kerosene bowed and left. Sabel nuzzled at stone and walked off, and stone felt he oughtn't follow because she'd said good-bye, though he wanted to. Was left alone, eyeing Akan warily. Moved as soon as he could and hid in a tiny patch of blueberries, hoping someone else he knew might come along, not surprised when no one did.</p>
		
		<p>He stood, scenting the air wondering where he ought to go next, when Akan took interest in him. The serval-kudu-cervid approached him brashly, and understanding that he could not possibly outrun the threat, he instead turned to face him. Stared him down, ears pinned, really not in the mood. Akan seemed to rush him, and stone issued a warning huff, not yet leaping into a display of antlers for fear that might incite violence where perhaps a display might suffice. Akan didn't actually seem interested either, and instead turned and went to sit down where he'd been standing before. Stone remained standing, and staring. He was tempted to go over and give Akan a piece of his mind. If Akan were smaller, if stone were well, maybe. He decided it'd be best to leave. Not recognizing anyone, he instead limped off to the Pond.</p>
		
		<p>He took a long drink. Finally, it was a day warm enough to wallow a bit, get himself freshened up <s>so he could wallow in his own piss after</s>. He enjoyed the bath immensely. He even played a little, though he hurt himself in the process, and it wasn't as fun alone.</p>
		
		<p>He went to dry off what he couldn't shake off in a bright sunspot near the willow tree he'd essentially eaten the month prior. He relished the warmth, the painkilling effects of the willow he'd eaten earlier, the feeling of fresh mud between his hooves. He's mark himself later, after he dried. Flopped over on his side like a dead deer to best enjoy the sunlight.</p>
		
		<p>Against his better judgment, he went to the group Ross was in to check on him. The trip over was uneventful. Many denizens seemed to be resting.</p>
		
		<p>Ross was resting too, at Shardul and Nikhil's den with their two children and a few others. Stone stood by trying to look as inoffensive as possible, but gave up not long after, not wanting trouble. He loved the area too much, however, and so ventured into the tall grass to rest, ending up somewhat in between Nikhil and Shardul, who stood together, and Miriam. Despite not wanting to be around any of them, really (Miriam might be fine but stone wasn't about to find out), he also felt that it was stupid for a group to have a claim on a large patch of land in a finite Forest, and so this place ought to be open to sitting in. No one seemed to object. He did not, however, wallow in his urine just yet, as that would absolutely send the wrong impression toward any overzealous individuals nearby.</p>
		
		<p>Was joined by Ross. Was feeling kind of shrug so just sat. (I do hte lag. Minutes pass and no one moves. This is it, this is purgatory.) They sniffed. Rossamund smelled like stress. Stone was worried, but before he could express it, Ross moved off to greet a looming Christian. Not keen on the vibe he was picking up, stone stood for some time, then just moved away.</p>
		
		<p>He found a patch of thick grass near Red Hill and settled down again. (Elliot's play could not connect to TEF, but we pretended Elliot got in anyway.) Was joined by Elliot and hung out with him. Was also joined by Stria and hung out with her too. Eventually, right as Kerosene came by to visit, Stria protested something stone had said loudly and stormed off. Stone abandoned his company to follow her so they could talk.</p>
		
		<p>The two ended up falling asleep together without moving, and stone went away to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, at the pine tree closest to the Crying Idol. Blearily got his bearings. Cold, sore, he felt for friends, and sensed Talla and Ross together far off in the Birch. He went to them, but kept his distance, uncertain if he was welcome. He did his best to burrow into a tangle of grasses in the sun to conserve his warmth.</p>
		
		<p>Talla greeted him and moved closer but he didn't notice until sometime later because his head was buried in grass (like when you're really cold so you pull the covers over your face for a little while). She deposited a blanket near him and returned to Ross. Stone, in a fit of pride and in an effort to display his nature, got up, grabbed the blanket, and brought it back to her. "You dropped your blanket." He returned to where he was sitting. It was not that he didn't need it, didn't want it. It was not that he felt patronized or pitied or weak. It was that it was not her responsibility to take care of him; it was his responsibility to take care of her, of anyone he liked. He was an old stag. He had to be strong and tough and reliable. He had to be a foundation upon which others could always rely. If he faltered, or seemed to falter, he would be disappointing them, failing them. He could not take from her something which she could use, should use. Her comfort was above his. That was his job. That was everything he was born to do. He was a guardian and a servant of those he strove to impress, and if he was going to delight in the joys of being the "patriarch" of a herd, he would shoulder the responsibility of it too. And it was a heavy burden, often painful, sometimes deadly. That was something he'd been resolved to from the moment he understood why he was at all.</p>
		
		<p>He continued to watch the two from a distance, pausing to tuck his head to warm his face, until he put his head down and did not lift it, succumbing instead to sleep and returning to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, near the Pond. Didn't sense anyone he knew. Grazed and drank alone, then moved upstream to the patch of grasses just beyond the Crying Idol, where he'd spent so much time with his friends not too long ago. Stood and missed them, wondering why they weren't around. Things were very lonely without a one of them. He elected to stand because it hurt, and something told him he needed to push himself even if there was no one around to make him, because otherwise he might not get better. So he stood and ambled and tried to keep himself company, but he'd already fallen into lonesome melancholy and nostalgia and it is not so easy to get oneself out of that. He half grazed, half pretended.</p>
		
		<p>Then, rather suddenly, Kerosene was there, and stone was very thankful for that. They took his mind off of things he shouldn't dwell upon. After sniffing them, they settled and stone continued to stand. His ribs stopped aching between breaths after a while, which he assumed was good.</p>
		
		<p>Looking at the poppies, he pondered for a long while before deciding to eat some. He wasn't sure why, it just seemed like an idea. He started to feel much better after that.</p>
		
		<p>He didn't eat much, but felt he shouldn't. He turned to head back to Kerosene and discovered the other closer to him, sitting. He sat a pace away, facing the other direction, enjoying the mysterious warmth Kerosene seemed to emanate. Finally started feeling well enough to start work on his scrapes. Started a new one out of the antler tree nearest the Crying Idol. Then plopped down like a lump. After a moment's thought, moved to plop down next to Kerosene again like a warm lump, his stagliness drive sated for now.</p>
		
		<p>Kerosene left and stone watched them go, moving back to the more comfortable grasses. They returned with a fawn. The fawn proceeded to yell in stone's face and stone accepted that because what else can do you. Kerosene and their friend left not long after that and stone shrugged off the whole thing.</p>
		
		<p>Nodded off for a time and awoke to Stria nudged up to his side. Flipped his shit and booped at her before half climbing onto her and settling there because Stria. Eventually moved aside. Followed her when she moved to graze.</p>
		
		<p>Flipped again when Red (and Saosin) showed up. Nuzzled the Red. Sniffed at Saosin and got bumped. :I'd through it and bit back his pain response. Stria became possibly <em>the</em> grumpiest and went off to angrily eat. Stone yelled at her then gave up. Red went to check on her, she grumped. Stone joined checking on her after trying to nudge Saosin into coming with no success, she grumped. Red went back to Saosin, she grumped. Stone gave up and went back to the pair, she really grumped. He had no idea so he figured it'd be best to let her sort it out. She went to go violently eat a tree while stone sat beside his newest scrape tree and Red eventually joined him, Saosin sidled up next to the Crying Idol.</p>
		
		<p>Stone noticed Thais lingering somewhat nearby and frowned internally. He'd never gotten over seeing her, maskless, sitting in the water supply. When she turned to face he and Red slightly, he just grumped more. Speaking of grump, Stria returned and flopped into him, having eaten the fuck out of that tree. He booped her with his face and they were good. Fell asleep and drifted off to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Blue Bowl. Took some time to collect himself. Noting a decently-sized group of strangers, elected to move away from the Bowl. Talla was seated alone off near The Playground so he went to her, taking some time to decide what a "polite distance" is in steps. Settled quite a few paces away to be sure. Two was always better than one. He grazed on the growth at the base of a tree while sitting to himself.</p>
		
		<p>Heard Kerosene approaching long before he saw them; smelled them long before either. Couldn't place why something that looked like a deer would smell like that, but they weren't the first fire-smelling being he'd scented, and he was sure they wouldn't be the last. After sniffing at the being as a greeting, they decided to sit, and so stone returned to his spot and continued grazing, and was otherwise boring company and a terrible host. He hoped Talla wouldn't be bothered by Kerosene (or himself, for that matter), but she seemed to be alright with them. (A.K.A. the sound of Wind being AFK.)</p>
		
		<p>Dozed calmly until Kero decided to bugle. Virtually teleported to his hooves, assuming it was an alarm call. When there was&hellip; Literally nothing, assumed Kero was declaring territory. However, Kero had just sat back down, so that didn't seem to be it either. Having no idea why Kero called, stone kind of just gave a look and sat back down, a little more wary than before.</p>
		
		<p>After nothing had happened for a bit, stone decided to carefully check on Talla. This was a mistake. Loudly approaching her so he wouldn't take her by surprise, he paused, waiting for her to acknowledge him. In this time, Kerosene decided to come over and say howdy-doo it seemed like, and after circling Talla she decided that was absolutely more than enough and put space between them. Stone, ashamed and distressed, tried to increase the space between Talla and everyone else by limping to another grass patch. When he turned around, however, Kerosene was approaching her and bowing. Displeased, angry, but aware that Kero did not have bad intentions (no one just acted that way to be mean, they were obviously just utterly oblivious), stone called in hopes it would draw Kerosene over to him, and it did. Kerosene paced around for a while after stone sat, but eventually sat down themselves. Talla, however, had decided that was not enough space and had booked it entirely. Stone sulked, feeling responsible. He eventually started to graze and ruminate after the mood passed, glancing at Kero every now and then.</p>
		
		<p>Kerosene left and stone didn't try to stop them. After he'd gathered himself, stone started toward the Pond, feeling rather lonely and vulnerable in the open where he was. The Pond wasn't really any better, but there was better food and water. He made it about halfway before he had to pause and rest, then made it the rest of the way. He settled in "his spot" to graze, drink, ruminate, and build cairns. As he worked on a cairn, Kerosene joined him again.</p>
		
		<p>Noticed Talla lingering nearby. Was delighted, but having decided he'd done enough, didn't draw any attention to her. She came and stood near the Pond's edge, so he stood to graze and drink as a show of peace, hoping Kerosene would follow. Thankfully, they did. Talla eventually settled near the logs, hopefully somewhat reassured. Stone sat back down and continued working on his cairn, determined to force casualness across the "group."</p>
		
		<p>Was distressed when Maggot settled close enough to see. Was also distressed when the Sea bull, Gisli, became obvious in the Pond&mdash;had admittedly completely forgotten about them and felt surrounded, though he knew (hoped) it wasn't intentional. Deciding to just play it cool, he continued working on cairns, though it was more of a front to observing his surroundings than an actual endeavour.</p>
		
		<p>Well, until he nodded off, like the old he is. And eventually drifted off to The Dark Place, like even more of an old.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest, near the Pond. Sensed the feral mule deer and Talla hanging out together near The Playground and limped to them right away.</p>
		
		<p>The mule was resting, and Talla seemed thoughtful, so stone settled in a few paces away, eating blueberries and bramble. Eventide eventually came and sat nearby as well, and he was a welcome addition though stone didn't make his feelings obvious (or really even known, u ass). Kerosene came by and stone didn't really understand them&mdash;but before he could figure them out, Stria arrived and stone rudely greeted her, barely heeding Kerosene after that (ass^2). The fire-scented being stood by calmly, and stone carefully tried to keep Stria's attention away from Talla, who he worried Stria would frighten or offend. Stria wasn't particularly known for her subtlety. Deciding Talla would be best faring for herself, stone led Stria to the Blue Bowl. He'd appreciate a proper graze himself, and he knew Stria could not turn down food. She didn't.</p>
		
		<p>He completely ignored the nearby sleeping Róta. He and Stria grazed together. He started shit. They play-fought with her trying to get at some blueberry branches she put in his antlers. He hurt his ribs. He had to sit but still play-fought. They sassed one another. You had to be there, like with the bitchy conversation they had on the way to the Pond the day they met Hitakomy...s. He had a great time though, he really needed it. Not being able to play had really been bothering him, more than he knew.</p>
		
		<p>He finally settled with her after Kerosene came by again and settled at the base of a tree nearby. Kerosene left some time after while they shared a general browsing area and otherwise just fatted together, likely still bickering here and there in a very adolescent way.</p>
		
		<p>Was very sad when Stria went away, but he supposed it needed to happen eventually, and he couldn't follow. He sat there for some time, hidden in the Blue Bowl, lingering in what remained of her scent. Having fallen asleep, he drifted off to The Dark Place.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, near the Pond. Stood up to stretch, his joints aching worse than usual. Figured it was all the sitting and the cold and the injuries. Settled again at the shore, grazing on plants and drinking his fill.</p>
		
		<p>After he'd ingested all he could, he found in himself the energy and will to seek a herd. He sensed The Red, The Inferno, Talla, and Rossamund. Seeking out the pair with whom he was most acquainted, he limped up past Red Hill to where they were seated, and nestled into the grass nearby, not in the mood to make any claims to dominance or what have you. There was no one to rut at anyway.</p>
		
		<p>As soon as he settled, he sensed Peregryn far away. Not sure if he'd missed her or she'd recently arrived, aching from his trip, he decided he still ought to check on her. So, as soon as he'd settled, he got back to his hooves and set off toward the Crying Idol.</p>
		
		<p>Definitely started to regret on the way over when his ribs started to act up. Decided to just tough through it and take a big rest once he'd gotten there. Though, when he did get there, he wondered if he might be invading, since the area seemed to be "claimed" by her a Yoko. Leaned against a tree while he powered through the worst of the pain, hoping he wouldn't be seen as intrusive.</p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately, he didn't seem to be seen as much of anything. Peregryn seemed distracted or asleep. When stone could move again, he decided to go check on Ross. (Stone, you idiot, their players are asleep!!) Much to his amusement, he sensed that human-faced doe who "kissed" him the day prior with him (Erytheia). He limped over, his ribs noticeably worse than they'd been. At least his lacerations were doing a lot better.</p>
		
		<p>On the way there, he accidentally found the company of three riley deer&mdash;an adult, a mini, and a fawn&mdash;all of whom seemed nice but confused stone somewhat. Trying to be polite, he wasn't certain how to respond, so decided to continue on his way. They followed, and the mini actually ended up settling with him. He propped himself against a tree, again, wondering why he kept doing this to himself. Ross and Erytheia weren't even awake. He just felt compelled to. He wanted to go check on Talla, but she was with a stranger, and he wasn't sure he could get that far. So he rested. Exhausted, he barely even realized when he slipped away to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, on Sloane's hill. Ross came to sit by him and stare, which stone was fine with and rested through. He realized he needed to drink so he finally got up and realized he was having a bad pain day. He limped over to the Pond and was happy when Ross followed, albeit at a weird distance. The myling did eventually join him again at the Pond's edge when he needed to have a rest and was grazing from a sitting position. When he stood again, Ross twined about him "like an oversized cat." Stone accepted this, though was a little confused. He settled again.</p>
		
		<p>After an unexpected nap, he awoke to discover Ross has left to greet Talla. Good for her, and for him. Though he enjoyed the fae's company, it felt right for him to be with the roe. She deserved good company such as his. He moved his head to rest on some stones and grazed lightly at the Pond's edge some more.</p>
		
		<p>THEN STRIA SHOWED UP. Nibbled at her until he had to sit. She rolled around in mud and was generally a cute doof. He booped at her and the mud some but, for once, didn't want to get too dirty for his wounds. Also it was cold enough without mud.</p>
		
		<p>Erytheia was sort of looming nearby so stone stood to see if she needed anything, assuming she was a friend of Stria's. They sniffed at one another, then she kissed him and ran away cackling. Confused, pleased, he stood there processing before going back to sit with Stria, who seemed more than a little jealous.</p>
		
		<p>Ended up flopping over Stria's back to nap. Still best pillow. Even with the mud.</p>
		
		<p>Delighted to awaken to Åsleif! ... Splashing them. Despite it, got up to nuzzle at her. She sat and he followed, moving under Stria who seemed to be watching something. Ended up falling asleep against Åsleif next, and drifting off to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Blue Bowl. Completely ignored the giant and tiny canids near him because they probably wouldn't do anything anyway and he just couldn't give a fuck. Fear wouldn't help him in his state anyway. Sat and ate and rested and ruminated and ate and rested and so on. He knew Talla was somewhere but he didn't want to disturb her again. He still felt badly for doing so once before, even though it had been some time ago. He scented Stria but he couldn't sense her. He occupied his time with cairns and thinking.</p>
		
		<p>He was joined by the tiny Kajetan (but I was afk so sorry ): ) and later The Red, who was apprehensive of the canid nearby. Stone couldn't care about it even then (and I was busy still) and so father and son moved off, where Talla who visited in the distance occasionally might feel more comfortable. They went to the valley in the Birch (a place I don't know how to describe, but it's rather heavily grass-covered and nice). Stone continued to browse and so on for some time before following after them. When he did, they been joined by Corvus. Stone sat away from him because he was weird, and away from Talla because he worried about being impolite and disturbing her. The Red came to greet him and he returned it, but he did not initiate grooming, feeling rather manly himself and not wanting to establish a submissive role this part of the season, not that it mattered for the time being. He found the densest grass he could and settled in it, and Kajetan came to sit near him. Worried about Talla still, who was now alone, he stifled a frown toward the fawn, who he thought would be better off near her anyway.</p>
		
		<p>Frustrated with the fact she'd been left, he limped to the opposite side of her, putting her at the center of the group&mdash;though still alone. The grass patch was less spectacular, but it was fine enough. Then Kajetan and, thus, Red moved and his point was moot, but he tried and he hoped it counted for something.</p>
		
		<p>Saosin showed up, but stone was dozing so he didn't notice beyond the sounds of playful scuffling of adults and fawns. He continued and drifted off to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Loafed about without really realizing that there was no one around. (That feel when you can only connect when it's dark but you're having to maintain the illusion of a sleep schedule for work. Sleep well in orange-dot-land, stone.) Observed that his wounds are healing nicely. It was warm today.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest, on "Sloane's hill," where he basically always sensed her when she was around. Started toward the Blue Bowl, completely <em>astonished</em> at how empty the Forest was. (Literally only NINE PICTOGRAMS connected, wtf????? I haven't seen single digits for months omg.) Noticed Talla, but didn't know anyone else. Didn't want to spook or inconvenience her, so made his way past her without drawing attention to himself. Though, she was nearby, and he liked that. He grazed on the plants for a long time.</p>
		
		<p>Was approached by a young deer (Chara) carrying a live, albeit barely, squirrel in their mouth. They hopped circles around him and he concluded that they were going to eat it but were, for some reason, showing him first. Disturbed, he backed away, then turned to limp away&mdash;not actually threatened, just unsettled. Chara left and he resumed sitting in the patch he'd been coming to, though now more uneasy than he had been. But it passed. He ate all he could, ruminated, ate some more, slept for a while, ate more, etc. Another excellent healing day, though rather boring. He tried to make cairns out of blueberries but it didn't work.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually went off to The Dark Place, feeling pretty alright.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest beside some trees between the Pond and the Blue Bowl. Limped to the Blue Bowl, plopped down, and fed for a couple of hours, alternating between eating and chewing his cud.</p>
		
		<p>Finally found the energy and will to move back to where Åsleif was. Was standing to observe her company (E.G. frantic map checking; it was Isiel, Icarus, and Ison&mdash;"I" party!) when she approached him. Groomed her in his characteristic buttering-up "chivalry," then had to plop down for his legs. It was colder out here in the open, so when he settled away from him, he half-rolled half-crawled to her. Sat chewing his cud and pretending to be warm. Someone came and sat with Ison&mdash;every member of Åsleif's company remained a mystery to him, though he did remember Isiel and Icarus vaguely from when the fawn had thrown a tantrum and sprinted to hide beneath him and his herd some time before (a week ago, the day stone was injured). Kind of wondered what had been going on, but not enough to bother pursuing an answer.<p>
		
		<p>Finally stood to go drink from the Pond. Got half-rushed by strangers but didn't have the energy to give a shit. Made his way there alone, but was joined by the mule deer on the way. Didn't actually <em>notice</em> the mule until they was drinking nearby. Stone completely ignored anyone nearby because he was under the impression that they'd keep to themselves; the mule, however, spooked away from them. Stone continued to drink and pick at some water plants alone, eventually going to settle at the willow tree to chew its bark. He'd just sat down when he realized this tree wasn't in happy shape from all he chewing, so he stood and moved to another tree farther up the shore. He chewed on the willow for some time, reapplied the paste as he had been, then sat a while waiting for it to take effect. After it had, he moved out into the grassiest part of the Birch near De Drinkplaats (which he was coming to be okay with, as long as he wasn't in it). The mule deer joined him again on the trip, and they settled in some thick grass together. It seemed like the perfect place.</p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately, Nikhil and Shardul thought so too, as their den was in the rocks nearby. Stone was uneasy about Nikhil in general, particularly so close, but he assumed that since they weren't really intruding, it would be fine. And it seemed to be for a long time. Peregryn showed up, and stone greeted her and awkwardly tried to express how much he wanted her to stay without crossing any boundaries. Sniffed at her several times and half-groomed her before darting away. Overall, just ended up looking rather daft. She stayed anyway. Just as stone decided to move, and hoped they'd follow, Nikhil stood and seemed rather confrontational (according to deer body language, you noodle). Stupidly, stone took a challenging posture while Peregryn and the mule slowly followed him, eventually turning tail and casually limping away, not having been intimidated (by someone nine times his weight, lmao, okay stone).</p>
		
		<p>They found themselves between De Drinkplaats and The Playground, in the broad and reddish valley-expanse near the Blue Bowl. Stone grazed a bit while Peregryn confused the heck out of him and the mule deer by being rather rambunctious in ways they couldn't understand (she was just being herself, but stone didn't know her well enough to realize that and so continuously worried something was wrong, on more than one occasion standing to limp over and sniff at her to be certain she was alright). When stone settled, she went off, staying at the periphery of his sight. (Then a newer player came and all three broke character to play with them, and my OOC joined because more deer is best deer. Red showed up in the middle of this and joined, but Vee had to take him out right after they got back IC.) Peregryn and the mule deer sparred, which impressed stone. He sat back and was both jealous and entertained. Then the mule joined stone and Peregryn stood there; stone assumed she was keeping watch. After a final "nose-boop" (omg so cute), she moved on some time later. Stone and the mule dozed on and off together.</p>
		
		<p>They moved to Red Hill where The Red and The Inferno rested. They continued resting. Overall it was a boring but comfortable time. Red and Saosin moved off and stone took that as them wanting alone time. The mule deer decided to graze and he noticed Stria so he went to her. She was with Sloane and Lobo, who stone had decided were probably okay (SLOANE IS SO SWEET OH GOD), but Indigo and Slattern were there too so Nope(TM). Instead, he grazed for the fifth main period that day, pushing over very small saplings and picking them clean. When he was full, he settled in a patch of hyacinths nearby in an attempt to keep warm, but they weren't enough. He tried to move to the mule deer, but they were too far. Though he felt a little odd about the Ruins, he entered them and decided to hide in the pit, where he felt the cold wouldn't seep.</p>
		
		<p>Then he felt Stria moving and got up to see what was going on. Evidently Sloane and Indigo + Slattern had moved off, leaving Lobo and Stria who were at play. Stone came over and tried to greet her, but the pair remained at play for some time. Then Lobo ran off after Stria sat, and stone joined her. He absorbed warmth from her and started feeling better. They were joined by Elliot, who was pleasant company and more than welcome. Stone liked how quiet the Irish elk was; he seemed refined and dignified because of it. Stone respected that. The mule deer came back and stone greeted them, and Bayleen came by as they were greeting so stone sniffed at her and kind of invited her over too. They all sat and it was good. Bayleen eventually went off Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go. A human-faced squirrel (named Wesley and who, to be honest, rather alarmed stone but what would he do?) came and went. (There were probably others but I dragged Wind into a film. >A>)</p>
		
		<p>Got up, really wanting to play but not able to. Limped around lamely while Stria and muley ran around having fun, trying very hard to also be having fun. Just kind of hurt and felt ridiculous. Stria challenged him to a fight and what self-respecting stag in rut declines that? They proceeded to have the most delicate booping session because Stria is a precious bean who is occasionally capable of careful thought and action; Stria then leaped into stone but he held his balance and declared himself the winner, much to Stria's bewilderment.</p>
		
		<p>Stria tried to get Elliot's attention, but could not. Nor could stone. He must have some heavy stuff to deal with (dat afk), which stone respected. Singed fur tended not to come from nothing. Stria and the mule deer ended up tussling for fun (two in one day you go hun). Then Summit disconnected (RIP) and Stria and stone briefly mourned the mule deer's apparent defeat-death. They groomed to comfort one-another in the troubling times. Then stone had to sit down, which surprised no one. Muley stayed d/c'd for the rest of stone's visit. Stone groomed at Stria some move when she sat down with him, and ended up falling asleep with his head rested tastelessly on her back. Adopted daughter best pillow. Went off to The Dark Place a long time afterward.</p>

		<p>Awoke, on Red Hill. Peregryn was still there, resting. Eventide was not far off. Stone had <em>definitely</em> been too active yesterday, and needed some willow to relieve the pain. He stood and started limping his way to the Pond.</p>
		
		<p>On the way, by the time he was starting to doubt if it was worth it&mdash;as he'd been doing partway through every walk he'd had lately&mdash;he passed Åsleif. He really just wanted to sit by her and suffer through it, maybe just ask for more herbs, but he didn't feel right about that. He kept on until he reached the willow tree by its spot, and took to peeling away bark where he had been. He'd need to move to a different tree soon. Chewing the bark into a pulp, swallowing some and licking some into his wounds, he found an odd sort of peace that was more than likely induced by the willow itself.</p>
		
		<p>When he'd finished with the willow (or rather, chewed as much as he could handle), he moved to the Pond itself to wash down the willow with Pond water and gorge himself on water plants, now that basically no one was around and he doubted he'd be bothered, even by the Sea Bull who sat inside the Pond, or by Nyami who sat up toward the bridge (a lot of strange water creatures today...). The Forest seemed quiet for now. Almost peaceful. He drank and fed.</p>
		
		<p>Moved up to Åsleif when he was full. Ruminated by her resting form. Nudged at her when she rolled. Otherwise just sat together.</p>
		
		<p>Dozed for a while until he had some antlers cast upon him. Thankfully, it only put feathers on his own antlers, so he just shook them off. Then suddenly he had a whole new pelt with feathers and tiny nubs for antlers. Distinctly displeased, sad he'd have to go to the Pond and get cold and wet just to get this shit off, he looked at the offender (Vala, PLS!) and started limping to the water. He came back wet, cold, in pain, and grumpy. Thankfully, the paste stayed put, somehow. Åsleif clearly felt guilty for finding it funny at first, so she shared her blanket after he shook himself off some and did his best to roll around in the grass to dry. Grumped to himself until the mood passed.</p>
		
		<p>The mule deer joined them. Relaxed, too relaxed, he slept and returned to The Dark Place.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, on Red Hill. Opened his eyes and lifted his head just slightly to see a Stria-coloured blob a few strides from him. As her scent reached him, knew it was definitely her and limped to her before his eyes could resolve her form any further. Puffed down in the curve of her belly and settled back down to sleep more, not actually having been ready to be awake, merely ready to be here again. Completely trusted her to keep him safe. (DESPITE WIND BEING BUSY YOU NOODLE.) Noticed Kauna, Svolnir, and a stranger (Ebolah).</p>
		
		<p>While he slept, Åsleif joined them on the hill, though he didn't notice because he was OUT. Stria eventually left; disturbed by her absence, he looked up to find Åsleif where she was, though with some distance between them. He closed the distance, mumbling a half-asleep apology to her about possibly getting her blanket dirty. He fell asleep again, his age and injuries having caught up with him. She already thought poorly of him&mdash;or so he assumed&mdash;so he no longer saw reason in portraying himself as anything other than he was: an old and proud, but injured, stag who just wanted the respect and comfort he'd once known back home.</p>
		
		<p>Had a talk with Åsleif. Was given herbs to eat and was allowed under her blanket again. Didn't expect it to last, but relished it while he could. Started to feel remarkably better, though he was still hungry. Was uncomfortable about Vasilisa hanging out behind them, but she left soon enough.</p>
		
		<p>While they were still talking, they were joined by the mule deer, who settled nearby and looked a little confused at their speech. Åsleif immediately moved to sit with it and stone followed her <strike>because she had the blanket</strike> because he enjoyed closeness right now, and needed the warmth.</p>
		
		<p>Together, after deciding with Åsleif that they ought to drink and eat, they moved down to the Pond and each took long gulps of water. Stone tried to graze on some of the Pond plants, but Akan decided it would be fun to run into the group and scatter them. Stone was too fucked up to run, but looked after him like, <em>seriously?</em></p>
		
		<p>Limped after Åsleif and muley who had regrouped near Red Hill. Åsleif went off Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go, and so stone felt a bit more comfortable leading muley to the Blue Bowl to graze. However, once they got there, the mule deer was utterly apprehensive about spookies nearby (including Ramsus, Grímkell, and Starless). Stone tried to graze but the mule deer had an excellent point, so he led them over to where The Red, The Inferno, Elliot, and Bayleen were resting. Thought Bayleen was a little odd, but Red trusted everyone there, so she was fine. The Red nuzzled him which made stone feel :<em></em>D. Then Saosin was chasing the mule deer all the way to the First Forest and stone was pretty grumpy. Tried to tell Saosin off but he was just a chaotic whirlwind of selfish fun-having. Limped desperately after the mule deer in an attempt to let them know everything was fine and that Saosin was just a playful dick, but he couldn't catch up. Met Peregryn and Yoko by the Crying Idol but he was too tired to properly greet Yoko or reintroduce himself to Peregryn so he just ended up sitting and resting while Saosin and Red fought and the mule hid somewhere far away. Ended up eventually catching up to the mule deer. Groomed them. The Red came over and taunted at Saosin as if to tell him he was still in trouble and couldn't come over. Saosin tried to bribe his way back to stone with a half-destroyed soggy pinecone but it didn't work. Saosin then tantrum’d away, tried to make more friends, realized there were only weird cats and dogs, and ended up sulking back to them later.</p>
		
		<p>Before that though, stone, The Red, and the mule deer moved to Red Hill, Yoko looking at them in seeming concern. (POOR YOKO BAE.) Stone settled with the mule deer by the tree he'd been scraping against last rut season and would start once he was feeling better this season. Yoko and Peregryn settled together (after Peregryn did some rounds). Elliot sat alone. The Red stood, looking at the very distant Saosin disapprovingly. Saosin sulked around them and eventually got close enough to cause stone to stand, to sniff him for his motives, but Saosin moved off too quickly. Stone came and sat back down, dubious of Saosin's intentions.</p>
		
		<p>When Saosin returned, stone went over to sniff at him again, and Saosin started to groom him (2 butter him up lmao). Stone ate it up readily, though he wasn't convinced of Saosin's good intentions yet. He returned to sit by the mule, got annoyed when Saosin followed, but then he groomed some more and he guessed it was okay... If only because there was an audience to see the display and know stone totally got actual game (it wasn't a farce or anything...). Saosin ended up sitting with Red and the two of them went off not long after. Apparently Saosin didn't intend to cause any more trouble today. Huh.</p>
		
		<p>Ended up falling asleep beside the mule deer, having distinctly overtaxed himself while limping through the Forest today. Akan was nearby and so stone stood to see what was up, but he was just hanging out with his own friends, and among them was Ross (as well as Cole and "Jack," "the Albatross"). He, for some reason, trusted Ross enough to assume the best of the group, that for now Akan would be no trouble, so he settled again&mdash;though still facing them&mdash;and dozed some more.</p>
		
		<p>Awoke to S. sitting nearly. Was at first apprehensive, worried the fawn might have brought something with him again. When there were no raptor-deer or anything else, he grew less wary and sniffed at the fawn. Though he didn't like the company S. seemed to keep, especially considering what odours clung to him, stone couldn't yet fault the fawn for his judgment. In all honestly, his judgment would likely soon fault itself. So after sniffing at S., he settled with the fawn, everything apparently smoothed over, started anew. The fawn seemed different somehow, stone noticed while looking at him, but he couldn't place it. He must just be growing&hellip;</p>
		
		<p>Talla came by and nervously smelled stone after some standing about. She sat with the group for a while, but always away, and eventually left.</p>
		
		<p>Was joined by Petra, who seemed nice. Peregryn came back and joined Yoko. He was starting to feel a little odd again, so things seemed to be different than they were. Elliot moved off at some point, which was a shame. Petra went away. Stone was sleeping a long time, and eventually drifted off to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Blue Bowl, feeling like he'd missed something. (I have missed every single birth this season let me die.) Stood soon after and started to limp over to where he sensed The Red and others.</p>
		
		<p>Or tried. Was shaky on his legs to had to stand and wait through it, determined not to just sit back down again. Åsleif actually noticed him and ventured over; they groomed a while. She nudged him and he fell over. Ashamed for looking so frail, especially around a doe whose attention he coveted, he slinked back into the Blue Bowl for a moment to collect himself.</p>
		
		<p>When she also seemed ready, he "led" the way up Red Hill. He saw Talla who stood, and so he adopted a non-threatening posture, worried he might frighten her off like he had when he'd approached before. She belonged here; she was here first. He hated taking the place of someone else. Thankfully, she had stood out of concern for him, not about him, but he understood that too late and just felt stupid for worrying.</p>
		
		<p>He and The Red were awkward. He thought the red deer was trying to see the extent of his injuries, and he wanted to hide them. He didn't want anyone seeing how bad off he really was, treating him differently. Because it wasn't just the wounds, it was the fact he wasn't coping with them very well, and where he came from that was a very bad sign. The red deer went off without really interacting, which made stone feel worse. Cresting the hill and looking past Kostya, he saw Kauna and her fawn, whose name he did not know and whose mother he had not even greeted when he'd seen her last, though he'd been happy to see her at the time. He couldn't remember why he hadn't at least said hello. He wanted to go welcome the fawn, to check on Kauna. Certainly, if the others weren't nearby her, he didn't belong there. He found a tree, his own occupied by the resting and healing Ross. He sat. Talla came to sniff at him but he didn't have it in him to be polite, and merely sniffed at her as a gesture while sitting. She hurried away and he felt guilty.</p>
		
		<p>Stopped feeling sorry for himself long enough to realize everyone was sitting alone. Moved close to, but not touching, Åsleif, remembering that he wasn't allowed under her blanket anymore and worried that she didn't want him there. Thankfully, she moved over to him and seemed interested in grooming at him.</p>
		
		<p>Over the course of sitting next to her, he started to feel better. The mule deer came and joined the group and stone was quietly happy about it.</p>
		
		<p>Sleeping on and off, stone returned to The Dark Place. (RIP Hum going to work.)</p>

		<p>Awoke, basically inside of the Tiger Den. Looked around for Stria but she was long gone. Got up and limped to the Blue Bowl to eat, not feeling well enough to make it to the Pond or stream for water. He hoped the moisture in the berries would be enough to get him by.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, eventually, made it. Settled into the bramble to hide himself fully and started eating. Stripped several plants totally clean of berries, leaves, and soft branches. Just ate, and ate, and ate. Chewed his cud, then ate some more. Found a lovely basket of food that perhaps belonged to someone else&mdash;it had a ring of stones placed around it? Thought it was strange, but it contained all of his favourite water plants, and so he ate the entire thing, thankful for it beyond expression. Slept on and off, but mostly just hid and ate. Easily put down five percent of his body weight in blueberry plants and whatever else was growing down there. Eventually became too full to fit anything else inside his stomach and lay down to sleep, getting some authentic actual rest rather than whatever The Dark Place gave him. Even though he always seemed to come back from The Dark Place feeling better than he would have if he'd spent&mdash;what he felt like was&mdash;an equal time awake, he felt that this time he needed to try to take care of himself and be around, too. The Dark Place hadn't taken his velvet, after all. Maybe it wouldn't help him with this either.</p>
		
		<p>Barely moved at all, slept for a long time, and eventually, when he sleepily decided it was right, moved off to The Dark Place.</p>
	</section>

			<h3><time datetime="2016-1-27">January 27, 2016</time></h3>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke&hellip; Somewhere? Maybe he was awake. He wasn't sure if he was still in The Dark Place or what. Then the pain hit and he was sure.</p>
		
		<p>He was at the highest point of the Playground. No one else seemed to be around. He sensed Saosin and The Red away. He sensed the feral mule and the feral sambar too. Others. He was still tired. He rested more.</p>
		
		<p>Awoke to The Red and some doe (Still not sure who this was.) nudging at him. Put his ears back to express his displeasure at moving. Solely to comfort the red deer, he eventually stood up. The Red tried to convince him to walk and that was hilarious. Eventually he tried.</p>
		
		<p>He made it off the rock and not much farther by the time Saosin showed up. He sniffed at the doe (git sum) and stone kind of half-consciously snuffled at him. Next thing stone knew, Saosin was hefting him up and they were limping very high off the ground&mdash;no, wait, stone was just high off the ground, Saosin was carrying him. Wait, Saosin was carrying him? <em>Put me down!!!</em> Struggled, or thought he was struggling. Really just kind of flopped and made some sounds.</p>
		
		<p>Found himself being rolled onto the ground by Saosin. Lay there for a while before righting himself. When he did, he found Åsleif fawning over him, which he greatly appreciated. "I bet you wish you'd shared your blanket with me now, huh?" He didn't expect a response, as it seemed like he was rarely understood.</p>
		
		<p>"I rather have a clean blanket." She responded. Surprised, he looked to her as she nudged his cheek. "Warrior."</p>
		
		<p>He tried to elaborate more, but the best he could manage was, "You should see the other stag. &hellip; Doe. &hellip; It had teeth." Åsleif, who had seemed impressed, suddenly did not seem so impressed anymore. Stone wanted to continue to explain, but words failed him. And so did his legs. He plopped down as the mule deer came to check on him. He was glad it was okay. Then it got spooked off by something, and stone wanted it to come back, so he limped over. He groomed at it to let it feel how he was, and was surprised&mdash;and relieved&mdash;when the sambar doe came up to him. Even though she'd been there when he'd returned yesterday, he couldn't remember how she was, if she was okay. Seeing the two of them only a little worse for wear put him at ease. Åsleif, meanwhile, became salty as fuck that he was greeting another lady <em>again</em>. Dem preggo hormones, like this stag ain't allowed to have friends.</p>
		
		<p>Returned to the group, which consisted of a loooott of things&hellip; Like, wow. (Stone was too out of it to fully recognize things around him. He kind of zoned out even while I was trying to pay attention. He's just really disoriented.) All in all, it was: The Red, The Inferno, Eventide, Åsleif, Averell, Luv, the feral mule deer, the feral sambar doe, Alain, the doe who came with Red to find him and liked to yell, and a white mini deer who no one seemed to know. Fovan was also nearby but stone didn't notice him at all. As time passed and stone came-to a little, he realized that Luv made him kind of uneasy, but he didn't feel like doing anything about it. He also realized they were basically inside of the tiger den and it made sense that the ferals didn't want to stick around.</p>
		
		<p>The sambar also didn't seem to trust Saosin so she and the mule deer went off to graze. Stone watched them wistfully, and watched Saosin and The Red play-fight with envy. Eventually stone realized that willow bark makes things not hurt, so he tried to get there. He made it to the blueberry bushes near-ish the Crying Idol and flopped down inside of one to rest and eat anything plant that was near his face. Not feeling moving yet, he also started to chew his cud when he ate everything in reach. Soon, The Red came to join him, followed eventually by the rest of the group. Circe had taken up her space in the tiger den, and stone was cool with that. In fact, in this state, he was basically cool with everything. Sasuda was Ruuning around and causing trouble. Umay was in there somewhere but stone didn't really follow/understand, he just knows Red bumped him. ): Then he limped to the Pond because it seemed like a good idea. He only had to stop once after that! And it was brief. When he made it to the Pond, he settled immediately at the willow tree near "his spot" and started stripping bark, chewing and eating some and shoving some bark paste into his open wounds with a grimace. When settled, and feeling remarkably better, he moved to the Pond and sat at the shore while taking a niiiiiiiice, long drink and eating some of his favourite water plants. He noticed Mjölnir and Nemesis sitting nearby who were kind of interesting and probably a little spooky but they were fine. Then Red was back and poking him again?????? Reeeeddddddddd I juustt want to siiiiiiiiiitttt........... Fiiine&hellip; Followed the Red across the bridge and back up to some bushes near the Crying Idol. (This is a good spot. Seeing this spot a lot lately and it's good.)</p>
		
		<p>The Red, The Inferno, Åsleif, Averell, the feral mule deer, the feral sambar doe, and Sasuda were there. Soon Farrel, a friend of the sambar's, came to sit with her. Stone sat and just lounged and rested. He came to when The Red was acting all alarmed and shit. Apparently there was a spooky or something. Eventually stone managed to swing his head over and see&hellip; Basically nothing. I mean, yeah, he was big, hut he was just a&hellip; Blue&hellip; Bull&hellip; Ram&hellip; Thing? (Khard.) The Red and Saosin left but stone didn't notice. Åsleif stood and was clearly frightened of the ram-bull, so stone decided it needed to be addressed. He stood protectively for a bit, groomed at Åsleif, before deciding to just&hellip; Treat it like a deer. He approached, sniffed, was sniffed. Honestly he didn't seem bad at all. Stone returned to the group, groomed at Åsleif again, and realized that The Red and Saosin were not there. Since they'd been the main reason he'd been so courageous, he was a little off-put, but tried to hide it. He sat. The ram-bull eventually just walked away, and no one seemed to mind him. Stone tried to follow, realizing too late he'd make for a very intimidating ally, but he kept walking and stone couldn't keep up. He came and flopped back with the group. He rested.</p>
		
		<p>Later a big horse (Xanos) was nearby on the other side with a small deer-ish thing with a long tail that smelled terrible (Milagros). Stone kind of just got up and limped over because why not. It's just a giant horse IT'S FINE THERE'S NO PROBLEM no need to be spooked by anything anymore (what's next stone are you going to crawl inside of a wolf). Things went remarkably well when stone sniffed him, he sniffed back, and stone really wanted to just express affection toward him because he wasn't causing trouble. What a cool guy just, being cool. Instant friend. Stone returned to the group and he followed. :<i></i>D Xanos and Åsleif sniffed and then sat together. The sambar and mule were not so easily won over, which sucked. The sambar was also with her friend, Farrel, who seemed to be with a small, amazingly blue doe (Moon). The ram-bull was near the Crying Idol and soon a completely horrifying thing (Maggot) was also there. The two interacted but stone could not understand what was going on. The sambar faced Maggot. Farrel and Moon seemed oblivious? Or not? Stone was very confused and wondered why they couldn't just go, move back to the group (now just Åsleif, Averell, and Xanos). Suddenly, Maggot was gone. Then the ram-bull was gone? And Moon and Farrel went and sat around a tree. The sambar stood with them and stone kind of paced between the two groups, eventually settling between them in a desperate attempt to unite them. He eventually sided with the sambar but only barely. Moon and Farrel left at some point. The mule deer was with stone and the sambar. Then Åsleif was gone. The mule and sambar grazed and moved off into the Birch, stone following when he had the energy. They eventually settled around some stones together. Stone slept.</p>
		
		<p>Woke to the sound of hooves. It was nothing, but he was awake, so he scooted over to groom at the sambar, only now really noticing that she was hurt. He tried to help, but of course there wasn't much he could do. He fell back asleep.</p>
		
		<p>Awoke only to find a THING ON HIS FACE. Shook wildly and it came off, then disappeared. Damn magic. Looked around and sighed when he discovered he was alone. Sensed the sambar and mule deer faaaaaaaar off. Took a second to prepare himself for the long limp, then got to his hooves and began.</p>
		
		<p>Paused for the first time in the foliage patch near the Crying Idol because it seemed right. Grazed on the plants to make the time pass faster. Debated going to the Pond for more willow, but didn't know if he could make it to both there and the ferals. Prioritized getting to them over eating painkiller.</p>
		
		<p>They seemed to be fleeing something, as by the time he got to where he supposed they were, they was basically the same distance away from him. Sighed again, but felt compelled to keep moving despite the pain. Maybe something was trying to kill them, and he couldn't have that. (As if he could help in his state.) He looked wistfully at the Pond, which he had just passed, and continued.</p>
		
		<p>Finally caught up with them just after passing The Playground. Or, rather, they turned to approach him, but it was good regardless. Just as he was sniffing at the sambar to see how she was, someone he didn't know (username maximus4) came Ruuning through in TEF deer play and startled them both. Distinctly angry, he challenged it immediately, not in the mood to have what he'd been working toward taken from him. They left, and he followed the sambar to the Playground, deciding himself to climb up a small rock to have a vantage point over much of the Birch Forest. He moved down when the mule deer fell asleep beside the sambar; he groomed at the sambar again. He slept on and off.</p>
		
		<p>Nearby, on the largest rock, Mar rested with Bree and Sasuda. Stone was wary of Mar, but he didn't seem to give a fuck, so stone also stopped giving a fuck. Slept on and off some more.</p>
		
		<p>Jerked awake because he sENSED STRIA. GOT UP TO SPRINT TO HER. &hellip; LIMPED TO HER. Had to rest in basically the middle of nowhere. There were some bushes and he ate while he sat, again. Swiftly he was becoming the king of eating all of the food. (Then I remembered my laundry had been sitting in the community laundry room for two hours which was fairly rude of me, so he got to rest an extra long time.) Rested again near Ross (AGAIN NEAR THE CRYING IDOL, LOL.) because it seemed safe enough. Finally got to her. (Literally over a half hour trip. Only from the Playground to the tiger den. My God, stone. If you need to slow down this much maybe you need to slow down altogether.) She was sleeping, but that was okay. She was Stria. He settled quietly beside her so as not to disturb her sleep. He watched her, feeling wordlessly affectionate. He was glad to see her again. It felt like it'd been so long. It was hard to be here without her, for long spans. He hoped she didn't feel this way about him&mdash;he'd never forgive himself. He lay his head on the ground beside her and let himself rest, feeling safer than he had in days.</p>
		
		<p>Awoke. Conversed with Stria while he motivated himself to go to the Pond for more willow. She at first was impatient then realized the severity of his wounds. He babbled at her literally the entire way (about forty-five minutes) and rested three times, clearly slowing down from earlier, though now it was more out of willfulness. He felt safe enough around her not to push himself, and acknowledged the pain and that he wanted to minimize it. Finally reached the Pond, passing a deer (username Hitakomy) who was doubled. Weird. Took a huge drink then settled at the same willow from earlier and started chewing all over again. Started to feel much better but honestly didn't really stop.</p>
		
		<p>Watched the doubled deer. They had sat down, facing one another. They were joined by a third identical deer, who sat facing stone and Stria. Then a fourth, who did the same. With growing concern, pointed this out to Stria. She panicked and insisted they move. Stone, we was still tired and who was not feeling the willow at all yet, said that he couldn't. Then a fifth came and he damn well booked it as fast as he could. When he and Stria reached the other side of the Pond, he had to rest. He ended up nodding off, and when he came to, he could swear there was a sixth. And they were all still facing him. He got to his hooves and hurried as best as he could, deciding to try to get to the mule deer.</p>
		
		<p>One by one, they rushed past as he limped by and Stria watched him anxiously. The first settled at the Twin Gods, facing them. The second ran past and settled on the Playground&hellip; Right near where the mule deer seemed to be. Desperate to check on his friend, stone hoped maybe they'd keep separating and not be a problem&hellip; A third ran and settled at the Playground. Stone tried to get to Stria, abandoning the Playground, now just wanting to be near her. A fourth ran directly by them. Stone watched it go. A fifth ran between them. They were all sitting on the Playground, still facing stone and Stria. Stone limped as fast as he could, worsening his injuries a bit, trying to keep up with Stria. They eventually reached the tiger den, which seemed like the safest place in the world by comparison. Stone didn't even mind. He snuggled tightly into Stria's side, trembling slightly with pain and fear, desperate to keep away from whatever that was. It didn't follow.</p>
		
		<p>&hellip; Right away. It ran by once a long time later, but then it vanished. Stone and Stria were horrified. Stone didn't think he'd be able to, but the terror lulled him into a strangely deep rest, and he was forced to return to The Dark Place. (Lmao guess who opens at work tomorrow&hellip;)</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, on Red Hill. Was sort of groggy, so ended up just sitting there getting his bearings rather than looking around right away, except to check for danger. Luckily for him, he didn't even have to look to find a herd; when he looked up after getting lost in thought <s>or sleep you lazy butt</s>, he'd been joined by the feral mule deer ("Summit"). They greeted with a sniff and he got around to actually scouting out the Forest. As he did so, the feral sambar hind's (Shenzi1) scent drifted toward him, and he noticed the mule catch it too. He decided that they should go to meet her, and the mule seemed to agree. (I had THE WORST LAG on the trip that I have since the last Abiogenesis I witnessed because I had three windows open and was messing with SpellData and apparently that is too much for my poor laptop.) They proceeded toward her together and met near the Crying Idol where there was much sniffing and greeting grooms. The two ferals proceeded to graze and stone elected to stand watch, feeling exceedingly protective and dutiful.</p>
		
		<p>Was surprised and confused when a youth (Icarus) and a smol (Isiel) sprinted over to his herd, startling the mule and swarming the sambar. The fawn was basically shrieking the whole time and it was really just terrible; it was clearly rebelling against the other to a very dramatic end. Was rather overwhelmed and just wanted them to leave, and they did not long after. The sambar led the group into the Birch where the pair of ferals continued grazing and stone continued watching over. Soon, a deer (username Anastasya) came by and completely did not understand "please leave" in feral (I don't blame you, dude). They left and came back, and were somewhat stubborn. Stone did his best to act as a barrier between the stranger and his herd, and looking back to them, the sambar led the mule away. Stone then led the stranger the opposite direction from them, desperate not to leave them but hoping that his <em>valiant generosity</em> would earn him favour when he returned. The stranger followed him a step away the entire trip and stood with him at the Pond's edge. Stone noticed The Kelpie lurking at the bottom of the Pond with a remarkable degree of alarm but did his best to keep it to himself, not wanting to lead the stranger into taking to him more, as he planned to ditch them at the soonest possible moment. The stranger walked off and he sat down as if to say, "look at me, being boring, who would ever hang out with me," having decided the stranger was completely harmless. The stranger, however, took this as an invitation to sit with him. Luckily, it disappeared not long afterward, and stone sprinted back to his herd. They all hung out at the hill near the Playground for a long while. Stone worked up the courage to groom at the mule deer, who all this time he'd been worried might reject him. Being around pure ferals always made him apprehensive now, worried that he'd become too "corrupted" by his knowledge and his new habits, worried that his old life wouldn't welcome him anymore. Thankfully, nothing of the sort happened. Stone grazed and chewed his cud. Nothing eventful occurred.</p>
		
		<p>The sambar led them elsewhere in the Birch where they all stood for a moment before stone hopped playfully and started a chain reaction. Having been apprehensive that he might spook the two by being too rambunctious, he started subtly. They both immediately took up and ran-paused, seeming to watch the others for a reaction. Eventually they were all Ruuning and jumping in disjointed play merely for the sake of it. Stone tired of it first, having already repeatedly paused to observe the Forest and fields around them for those who might take advantage of their distracted state. He began to graze again than settled to chew up what he'd eaten. The mule settled near him not long after, but the sambar took this opportunity to do the bulk of her eating then, settling a long time afterward. (U go gurl u eat that food.) They all snuggled.</p>
		
		<p>S. came across the group and tried to get stone to follow him. Reluctantly, very reluctantly, he eventually did. S. led him to the Pond, where he kept ducking his head into the water and otherwise trying to draw attention to himself in the Pond's direction. Apprehensive that he was trying to communicate with the Oceanbull, stone watched on. Luckily, the beast seemed distracted or asleep (as if stone knew about weird water critters) and so S. eventually gave up and went to sit down next to some spookies (Romulus, Róta, and Lieva). Having wanted to leave basically the whole time, stone simply looked on like, "Ok." He hurried back to the ferals, finding the mule away and guarded. Stone greeted them with a sniff and brief groom, then went to semi-gorge himself on foliage nearby. The mule deer joined him, but he was again the first to settle near the resting sambar. Realizing that it was rude of him to leave the mule without a standing guard, he stood back up a while later, but the mule had already finished grazing and was coming to bed down with the two of them. He sat facing the other direction, encompassing the sambar between them (as much as one could surround an animal of her size!).</p>
		
		<p>Heard some commotion in the distance&mdash;got up to stand guard. Sensed S. and&hellip; Greitai. Immediately took an aggressive stance. And of course, she came near. Would have chased her off even if she just ambled by in that mood. However, she did much more than that. Ended up sprinting, chasing right behind her, as she chased the mule deer for fun. Completely enraged, blinded by anger and hate, he continued to pursue her even when she stopped chasing. He relentlessly followed and attacked her, having decided to try to kill her. Even through her defensive and then less defensive bites and kicks, he kept at it, trying anything to get her to stop being. He tried to gore her, and to kick her, and to knock her over so he could crush her mouth to break her teeth. They both got each other pretty well before he became too tired to continue pursuing her. He only then remembered/noticed that S., who was terrified and very upset, had been there the whole time. The fawn had to learn eventually. This place was not pleasant and friends were few and far between. Stone only hoped that he picked the side he belonged on. Too out of it to manage it, and with S. distinctly preferring Greitai (A stranger, compared to stone who he'd seen all the time? Stone would be angry about this later.) stone abandoned him entirely. He stared her down for some time, making sure she wasn't just going to come back and try something else like she seemed to always do. When he was satisfied, he turned to find the sambar and mule once more, vowing that they were not finished.</p>
		
		<p>Dizzy from the adrenaline and unexpected loss of blood, he limped haphazardly this way and that until he found his way back. He sniffed at the mule, and at the sambar, and then he couldn't anymore and basically collapsed. Managed to drag himself a little closer to the sambar. Someone else had joined but the mule trusted them so he was sure it was fine. He didn't have the energy for it not to be fine. He started when he heard hooves, but it wasn't that beast, so it didn't matter. He was grateful to the mule deer who stood watch, though he doubted they would stay by if a threat came back, and at this point an alarm call would just let him know when someone approached so he could watch as they killed him. He was stuck for some time. Eager to sleep, desperate to sleep now that the pain was coming, he tried to force himself down and away, but he wouldn't. All those times he didn't want to go but did, now he wanted to but he couldn't, and he couldn't even sleep. Not for a while. When he finally did, it was tenuous and fitful and full of nightmares and phantom pains.</p>
		
		<p>Awoke to repeated alarm calls. The world was swimming. Looked at the mule and the sambar somewhat angrily, not sure why they'd wake him so soon after he managed to sleep. Abruptly noticed Romulus being massive on the horizon. Horrified, yet also somehow eerily at peace, turned to limp away. The sambar and mule deer bolted, but the other stayed with him. Romulus approached, and stone realized he could never outpace him. Turned to face what he supposed would be his death. Romulus broke out into a run and bolted past them, after the ferals. Bewildered, thankful, stone turned and tried to limp after them, eager to keep with them wherever they ended up, desperate to help if he could. Even if that was just to serve as a distraction. The other kept pace with him, and in his addled state he felt as much affection for them as almost any in what he'd come to consider his family. He got up to Red Hill, for some reason thinking they were there. Instead, a giant vulturish creature (Eliah) and winged being (Rakil) sat, and he realized they, like it seemed everyone around him was, were dangerous. He tried to put distance between them and himself, but he only got to the bottom of the Hill before he fell and had to rest.</p>
		
		<p>He motivated himself up a bit afterward. The other had taken his side. He started limping what he thought was the direction the ferals were. He got far enough to become exhausted and need to rest again before he realized he was going entirely the wrong way. Knowing in the back of his mind that he was disoriented, he suddenly realized that maybe he was dying. He had never been this wounded before. Never this overwhelmed, this strangely alone. He sensed Saosin far away, too far away. Maybe he would have protected him but he was too far. He thought of H.. He thought of Stria. He missed them. He blacked out. (I minimized.) Unknowingly, he returned to The Dark Place where it set about beginning the healing process.</p>
		
		<p>Woke back up. Had a headache. Things seemed&hellip; Wrong. (I didn't fully reconnect. Most Pictograms weren't showing and sets didn't seem to be displaying right.) Couldn't sense their names, but just knew&mdash;it must have been the Magic, and for once he was grateful&mdash;where the sambar and the mule deer were. Started the journey from near Red Hill. Stopped often, and for long periods. Felt sort of hopeless, but mostly just hurt. Was happy no predators seemed to be showing up, but was also sort of afraid because of it. Could he trust himself? He supposed he'd have to.</p>
		
		<p>Nodded off for a long while after having to pause. Wasn't sure how much time passed. Was pretty sure he was in shock. Wasn't sure how long shock was supposed to last or even exactly what it was. Arrived at the Playground (after nearly an hour, honey). Immediately collapsed. Didn't see or smell them. Knew they were supposed to be here. Didn't understand. Let himself sleep, eager for the release, not thinking about the risks.</p>
		
		<p>Returned to The Dark Place not long after finally making it there. (I got 2tired, lmao. Poor thing took a lot out of me.)</p>
		
		<p>(I drew a diagram of the <a href="https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/69603266_82411YlxuAg1ioq.png" target="_blank" onclick="">injuries to his left side</a> and <a href="https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/69603198_shizzrndEoKotup.png" target="_blank" onclick="">injuries to his right side</a>.)</p>

			<h3><time datetime="2016-1-24">January 24, 2016</time></h3>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke, near Red Hill. Returned to it to sit while he sensed for anyone he knew. Sensed Talla, and Ross, but the former didn't trust him, and the latter was with others who he did not know. Growing bored, knowing no one else, he stood and trotted toward the Pond. Instead of eating or drinking, however, he veered toward the bridge and started sprinting across it, back and forth, practicing the movements, trying to figure out how he fell off yesterday. (Oh my God, stone, please.) This expanded into Ruuning and leaping across the stream, clearly now just seeking some exercise. The urge to fatten himself up had now been followed by the desire to prepare his muscles, and so he leaped, and leaped, and leaped. In fact, he was so busy leaping that he did not even notice S. until he quite literally almost ran into him. He's barely greeted the fawn when Red also emerged from the Forest, and he snuffled briefly at them, but his activity had spawned a session of play, and they were only occasionally still. The stags jumped the stream while the fawn tried. Eventually they were just circling the Crying Idol (with the Swan Prince watching on from a distance, as stone noticed and recalled him) which caused S. to think that perhaps it was also a participant and so he challenged it to a spar. It clearly won because he was turned red and did not challenge it again.</p>
		
		<p>Then Saosin <em>literally came out of nowhere</em> and spooked both stone <em>and</em> Red. After getting over that, stone resumed the playful sprinting that all were now engaged in. The Red and The Inferno led them all deeper into the Birch Forest, away from a deer (stone hoped) who had just awoken, just in case. They resumed Ruuning and leaping, S. occasionally instigating tiny fights. Saosin nibbled at Red's haunches at the wrong moment and got kicked in the face. Hurt and offended, he sprinted off and stood in the distance looking toward Red ruefully. Eventually they made up, Saosin now chasing Red about to nuzzle his butt. Stone and S. merely chased each other about, then stood by to watch the shenanigans. Then things took a turn and stone was sprinting from Saosin to avoid whatever the giant intended to do. However, small healthy deer vs. large limping brute meant that stone seemed to be at an advantage. After all, sangai literally means, "animal in waiting while looking on," implying sangai have time to turn and wait while looking at their pursuer. On several occasions, he sprinted only to turn abruptly and sprint past Saosin the other direction. However, in his pride, he made many mistakes and got clipped more than once, even falling over twice and once having to shake himself off before he continued. He developed the notion that he wanted to get behind Saosin to "surprise" at him with a "BUH!"-like motion and stomping of hooves, as if to say, "I can get you too!" So, while Saosin was chasing stone, stone was also chasing Saosin. (And on more than one occasion, S. seemed to be chasing them both.) Neither of them really "won," and things settled down after a time, Saosin having clearly been the one mostly in control of the situation despite what stone thought.</p>
		
		<p>Play-sparred with S.. Was mercilessly victorious. Winners don't become winners by winning all the time.</p>
		
		<p>Ended up trying to creep up on Saosin to spook behind him, but he was more vigilant than stone hoped. While Saosin turned to watch him, stone mimed innocence, looking around and away (while I IRL commented like, "who, me?? nooooo... nahhh noooo of course not..... nahhh....") and even started to walk away until Saosin turned back around. The moment he did, cheesily turned and tried to creep up on him again. Was caught in the act fairly close-by and bolted. Red, having been watching the entire thing and nodding it on, went to nuzzle at Saosin as a distraction, but an inopportune fawn came by and ruined his plans. Red and stone glanced at one another in what could best be described as a promise that this was not over. S., who had seen the butt-nuzzling, took to it immediately and nuzzled stone's butt. Stone, however, simply turned and face him confrontationally as if to say, "U wot m8." S. stopped.</p>
		
		<p>S. had also taken to standing directly under stone, which he didn't mind but pretended to mind for the sake of the game. At S. went to hide there for what must have been the tenth time, stone whirled around, ducked his antlers under S.' belly, and hoisted him up into his tines. S. seemed okay with it, and stone set him down after cavorting around with him as a hat briefly.</p>
		
		<p>The Red had gone off to sit by Talla, Saosin went off to the Crying Idol (as he apparently does, stone was realizing), and stone and S. lay down together. Stone fell asleep for a while, puffing after all of the exercise (literally a bit over an hour of Ruuning).</p>
		
		<p>He slept so long and so deeply, in fact, that he only awoke to The Red, The Inferno, and S. all prodding him. (I was watching <em>Leverage</em> with my fam. Q Q It was a good episode.) They had been joined by Kostya once more and a feral mule deer (Summit). The Red and The Inferno led the group away from the Tiger Den, which stone realized they had settled right near (perhaps he was becoming too used to that scent). S., however, lingered behind with Talla. Concerned about him, stone doubled back to check on the pair. Reassured they were both fine and just being odd, he rejoined the front, thinking he'd follow soon. When he still hadn't, stone went to find him again, this time locating him at The Playground. He didn't seem interested in following, so stone just left him there like an asshole and came back.</p>
		
		<p>Stone observed the group (Red, Saosin, Talla, Kostya, the feral mule deer, and a fawn), and while happy, he felt&hellip; Off. He paused to sense about himself and felt Greitai. Disgruntled, he waded through the grasses until he found her. She stood to look at him like, "wat do u want old dude." Having none of her being so near to them (even though she was probably there first tbh) he advanced upon her, ears dropped, facing her directly in confrontation, angry. Not bothered in the slightest, she continued to eye him like he'd gone mad but otherwise didn't give a shit. Noticing something was amiss, Red came over and figured out what stone was going on about. Saosin joined him, and they all stared Greitai down while she turned her back to them and seemed to hope they'd just leave. (And smol fawn ran around as if everything was fine lmao.) Eventually Red backed down, then Saosin, then finally stone (really only because they both had). He returned to the group but, even though he couldn't physically see her, he kept up the body language. Saosin came over to groom/rub him a bit, but while grateful and relieved, he did not stop facing her. (Stone pls it's fine.) She eventually moved on and he could have sat down, but he could not settle after that and continued to observe the Forest around them, acting as sentry while everyone else rested.</p>
		
		<p>Rhona joined the group at some point and sat with Talla. He continued to observe for some time. (We played OOCly with a little fawn who was nice.) Eventually, reassured that things were okay now, he settled near the mule deer. He was growing hungry, but was feeling too dependent on others to graze alone, so he waited until another exhibited interest in feeding. Ended up falling asleep while waiting instead. (Because I had to go grocery shopping.)</p>
		
		<p>When he awoke, everyone had moved or left, and with some alarm he sought to locate any of them. Luckily, The Red, The Inferno, and the mule deer were near the Crying Idol with Yoko&mdash;who he was delighted to see. He immediately joined them and, seeing none of them stand upon his approach, he sat down and well, merely looking around. When the mule stood moments later, he followed suit and watched it walk toward his back, trusting it implicitly. He decided now would be a great opportunity to feed, with plump food-plants so nearby, and so he gorged himself upon blueberries and their leaves, then moved to the darker green stalks with their small blue and green buds, and so on, eating some of this and some of that as he desired.</p>
		
		<p>Was interrupted by a newcomer adult and fawn (respective usernames Khalissi and OpalBeam). The adult greeted him with a nuzzle right away, and was very loud, so stone was off-put from the start. Things simply got worse, from stone's perspective, as they lingered around drawing attention to the group with a lot of noise and were just generally confusing and off-putting. Eventually, The Red got to his hooves and started a boxing match with the other. This continued on and off, stone alternating between a "please just leave, we don't want trouble," and challenging to fight posture. Half-fought a few times, the newcomer leaving twice or so. In the middle of it, Eloa arrived looking cute. Stone did his best to be inviting to the lovely white-tail, but was too preoccupied to be much of a gentleman. Ended up going hoof-to-hoof when <s>Vee got too polite but I stayed an asshole</s> The Red gave up on reasoning with the newcomer, <s>probably by chance alone</s> getting them to back up and eventually leave. Thought he would feel proud, but ended up just angry and grumpy about the whole thing. Went and flopped down beside The Red and bupped at him to improve his mood. Ended up chewing his cud, finally.</p>
		
		<p>A while later, got up to greet another newcomer, somewhat apprehensively. Thankfully, they were fine. (Username Greyfeathers and a total patoot. Played with OOCly.) Settled back down when he grew weary, knowing they were safe to relax around. Moved closer to the group and covered what he perceived as a vulnerable point. Chewed his cud some more and chilled.</p>
		
		<p>Then another wandered up (Akan) who Red took particular offense to. Stone, of course, followed through, because who doesn't trust Red's judgment. This happened a few times over a loooooong span of time, and each time the same response. Stone started to think he was just doing it for laughs, but he wasn't laughing. Settled beside the sleeping mule deer, hoping maybe he was done now that he seemed to have playmates off in the distance. Ended up nodding off. When he came to, Saosin and Red were away. Settled, a bit more watchful, close to Yoko and the mule deer, not relishing how small the group had become, especially with the influx of denizens populating the Forest.</p>
		
		<p>S. came and plopped wetly against him which was cool. Though he couldn't articulate why, he was glad the fawn had returned. He was definitely growing on the sangai (almost literally lmao). S. eventually left. Saosin came and sat to his left. Yoko moved to be facing the same direction as him, still to his right. Stria showed up and shoved herself between them. Stone woke up for that and moved to nestle against her warmth. He stayed awake for a while. Then he didn't. H missed she and Yoko playing, but he sensed an absence that he didn't care for.(Then I went to watch a show and fell asleep on the living-room floor, lmao.) Stria took his side again and he was happy. Yoko went and that was okay. The feral mule deer stayed to his right. (Player must be asleep, bless.) Saosin moved off toward the Crying Idol when he was visited by Ravyn and was still mystified and thus remained. (And then Hum went to bed-bed.) Stone got up, adjusted himself a little, and fell back asleep nestled into Stria, waking up occasionally (non-portrayed) because deer only sleep for at most a half hour at a time. He groomed her half-presently, he chewed cud, he grazed on nearby plants, he made no fewer than four cairns, he watched. He stayed.</p>
		
		<p>Went off to The Dark Place sometime <s>as I slept because TEF is a great game that never crashes for any reason</s>.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in a blueberry bush. Didn't sense anyone he knew nearby&mdash;or, rather, no one he was friends with (not even Stria! dat connectivity issue, RIP Wind). He did sense Circe and, after some pondering, he went to get a better look at her. She was asleep in the Tiger Den so he didn't gather too much, and she did not rouse with him being nearby. To stone's right sat Roscoe and Rikkonel, who stone felt minor apprehension toward. Eventually, and luckily, he sensed Saosin on Red Hill, and after getting closer, recognized the other with him to be Rhona. He sat beside them, not even bothering to greet them (they seemed to be relaxing anyway).</p>
		
		<p>Ross <a href="https://i.gyazo.com/9393e542c108e3b13c289bc448852a86.png" target="_blank">came to say hi</a>. (Then a nameless and a player without a page showed up and I was feeling like not-an-asshole so I broke character to play with them. I, however, got tired, so stone sat back down while Ross/Echosong [bless your hearts)] continued to entertain.) When Ross eventually returned, they threatened to have another staring session, but stone repositioned himself to feel more comfortable and offered a simple, "Hello." Ross returned with a, "Hullo," and that was that. Ross tried his darndest to be polite and conversational, but talking to stone is like pulling teeth when he doesn't know you and doesn't feel obligated to talk to you.</p>
		
		<p>Then Åsleif showed up and shared her blankie with stone and Rhona and stone almost died. He just loves that damn blanket. Ross eventually fell asleep. They hung out for a while, then the [Formosan hind] showed up! Somehow, she was 2spooky to Rhona and ticked Åsleif off because suddenly stone was paying attention to her. Stone, completely not understanding why Åsleif was irritated, was concerned for her but didn't express it because he couldn't see anything he could do to help. Instead, he groomed the Formosan extensively.</p>
		
		<p>He tried to lead the Formosan back to the others, but she just stood there as she tended to do. Stone sat down, being less than gentlemanly. He noticed Stria in the distance some time later and yelled at her, but she yelled back and he gathered she was eating, which was good. She came to join them eventually and she stole the Formosan from him. He stood on the other side of the sika deer and groomed the two of them. Finally, curious and worried about Åsleif, he went and smelled at her to see if maybe she was hurt? He could not understand why she seemed displeased. Clearly more feral company was always good, and stone could do nothing for her that he wasn't already doing. Gave up and looked at Stria pitifully, trying to coax her to invite the Formosan to sit with them. Had to go butter Stria up because she was hogging all of the attention, and eventually she settled beside him, the Formosan standing watch between them.</p>
		
		<p>Finally decided to stop being an asshole and stood to allow the Formosan a chance to lay and rest her legs. Iichiko came over briefly to say hello to Rhona and then disappeared. Stone observed some beings who had been a ways away since before he'd arrived (Cassiopeia and Alika) do deer things.</p>
		
		<p>Realized he'd been distracted when he looked to find Åsleif gone. Disappointed that he hadn't caught her leaving, as he would have escorted her so she didn't have to go alone (Stria could, and would happily, hold things down on Red Hill). He hurried to catch up, S. also only having just discovered she'd gone, trailed by the black fawn. Åsleif was nonchalantly eating, drinking, and gathering water plants. She and S. started playing/splashing around and stone was, of course, brought into it by proxy. S. added to his already thick layer of mud. Stone stood and waited it out. Eventually, Åsleif vanished again to deliver food to The Inferno and The Red, who stone didn't get to see because he was oblivious to her leaving and only caught her on her return. She crossed the bridge and S. followed her right after challenging stone to a spar. Stone reared with pride and generally upped the ante by strutting his stuff and looking super cool. Taunting, strutting, he crossed the bridge, eager to come off of it at full sprint to look intimidating. What actually happened is that he got halfway across and (because I can't play games) he fell right off into the deep end of the Pond. Mortified, he stayed where he was long enough for S. to believe that the bridge had definitely eaten him, but because Åsleif was calm, S. figured that must be okay. (Thanks Åsleif, could have died and you'd only have known when a bloated corpse washed ashore a while later.) When he finally drained of embarrassment enough to move, he swam <em>all the way across</em> the Pond to avoid having to confront them directly. He exited and tried to shake the water and shame from his fur.</p>
		
		<p>Dry enough to pretend that was intentional, he returned to where they'd been to find... Nothing. (I SEE HOW IT IS, ÅSLEIF.) Finding them by their Pictograms, they'd since returned to Red Hill, S. now adorned with hyacinths. Stone went and rolled around in some dust and grass to get the last of the water out of his pelt so he didn't get too cold, then went back to stand guard. The Formosan sika hind left not long after, so he shoved himself into Stria's side for warmth and because he could finally lay down without feeling bad.</p>
		
		<p>Abruptly realized that the Formosan had not gone Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go, but had instead gone off to greet the feral sambar doe when he noticed them near De Drinkplaats. RUSHED TO HIS HOOVES AND SPRINTED OVER. Was bustling with a mix of grooming, posing, strutting, marking, and otherwise greeting. Was really just too excited to exist in a singular state. (HOWEVER I HAVE WORK AND HAVE TO GO. ): ) Plopped down and went off to The Dark Place from being too excited or something.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Went to Stria, though noticed she was with a sleeping Circe and Kio. Hung around nearby eating blueberries and watching them. Went to go try to drink from the Crying Idol. Was trying to grow his neck longer so he could reach it without getting wet when Stria came over, her distaste for the Idol evident. Nuzzled at her and they got to playing "kick up as much dust as possible while sliding around." Then he saw his own twin and got curious enough to follow them for a better look, so they sprinted through the Forest until they were satisfied. She then led him to the Pond where he drank and they ate. They sat at the edge of the Pond and he fell right asleep, apparently depleted despite his alertness. He went off to The Dark Place.</p>
		
		<p>He came back a while later and found her sitting where she had been, now alone. He felt a pang of guilt for leaving her, but that just seemed to be how this place worked sometimes. He took a moment to greet The Red and The Inferno who were resting nearby, and was surprised and totally overwhelmed when they both took to groomed him. Only got to boop at Red once or twice, but groomed Saosin for the first time which was very good for bonding to him. Perhaps he was completely fine after all.</p>
		
		<p>Returned to Stria as soon as he could, feeling bad for leaving right after coming back. She seemed pretty unfazed, but she usually did nowadays. The Red started to follow him, but Sao yelled and they seemed to have a tiff before settling where they were.</p>
		
		<p>Sat with Stria for a long while. Noticed some others come to visit his friends, including the little fawn, Kajetan. They all did eventually come to join he and Stria, Kajetan bolting over and bleating in Stria's face before plopping in front of her. Her neck fluff slowly absorbed him and <s>his life was unfortunately cut short</s> provided warmth and comfort. Red and Sao huddled a short ways away, and Kostya Kostya'd off behind them. Eventually, <em>Stria</em> actually went off to The Dark Place, which surprised stone but pleased him too. He hoped she got to go to a nice place like he did when he was gone&mdash;she seemed like she needed it.</p>
		
		<p>Stone curled around the fawn out of concern&mdash;if it was cold for him, it must be terrible for the calf, even if he was a less sensitive species. Red went to do Red things and Saosin was joined by Rhona. Then Grímkell and Jhorla showed up. Rhona and Grímkell played about, doing young-folk things. Jhorla stood by and observed, keeping her distance, which was fine by stone&mdash;she looked awfully spooky (at least Grímkell was too small to be a problem). Rhona soon was teaching Grímkell how to use blueberries to paint on others (ah, the tradition, it carries on&hellip;) which he took to enthusiastically. Stone, still caked with mud from days before when S. and Stria had gotten him, could not care less. Saosin seemed quite pleased by it <s>and was absolutely fetching</s>.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually, all but Saosin and Rhona remained. Stone ended up dozing, along with Rhona, Saosin polite enough to keep watch for the two of them. (Thanks dude.) When he was not sleeping, he was grazing on the berries and bushes around. He's put on a fair amount of weight in the past few days alone, thanks to the plentiful food of The Forest. Satisfied with socialization, eating, and sleeping, he lay his head down and return to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Sensed Stria and went to her. Sensed S. too but he was probably fine. She eventually responded to him a bit. He was debating going to eat (those pre-rut cravings) when S. found <em>them</em>. Stria ???'d at him until stone led them all to the Pond so he could eat and drink. S. and Stria ended up playing "get water and mud on everything." After they both had splashed at and smeared mud on stone one too many times, stone very gently knocked S. into the mud. Stria then DUNKED STONE INTO THE MUD. Stone, greatly disliking being shoved anywhere, and wanting to avoid getting wet so he didn't freeze, sought retribution in acting like she'd broken his leg. He limped pitifully up to the bridge, moping and looking after her like an old tragic film. Stria, completely falling for it, followed miserably; S. assumed that was simply how deer walk away from the Pond. Stone, satisfied with Stria's misery, then hopped around her like a dick. Angry but relieved, she threw a little tantrum at him and he did his best to appease it, feeling a <em>little</em> bad, but not really.</p>
		
		<p>Stuck on where to go, stone finally gave in and decided to see if Saosin was with The Red. Approaching Red Hill with Stria and S. in tow, he realized María and her new fawn, Kajetan (what an odd-looking thing, given his parentage), were there as well. Not certain how she'd respond to him, especially with a newborn, stone became a bit anxious and this never really went away. Stria, by now, was worried she might hurt the young ones by playing with them, and so was uncharacteristically still. S. was simply overwhelmed by the number of deer and so stuck to his current favourite, Stria.</p>
		
		<p>Stone eventually gave up for a bit and hurried off to the Blue Bowl to cope with his anxiety with food. However, there were already some deer there&mdash;namely Aina and her newborn, Sasuda&mdash;who clearly grew anxious at his presence, so he didn't actually feel any better and after shoving some berries down his gullet he decided to return to Stria for comfort. The Red and The Inferno had come halfway to, perhaps, see what was happening? Stone gave a sidelong glance to Red before hurrying to Red Hill. Aina and Sasuda ended up joining the group, now consisting of three stags, three hinds, and three fawns. After a bit, S. and Stria were at play again, and stone joined in (for once) followed by The Red and then Saosin. They chased around here and there, careful to avoid the hinds and their newborns who were plopped or adjusting. S. came up to stone in a challenge and boops were given.</p>
		
		<p>Stone finally sat down near Stria, half because he was tired and half to get her to chill. She never did, and soon The Red moved the group into a clearing nearby, S. being the last to be roused into movement. Kajetan briefly half-challenged half-nuzzled stone, and so he booped at the tiny red deer carefully, more careful than he was with S. who seemed down for anything. María, Kajetan, Aina, and Sasuda all settled in the clearing; The Red and Saosin settled on a hill; stone&mdash;seeing the other two stags resting&mdash;felt compelled to stand watch, and Stria and S. settled at his hooves.</p>
		
		<p>When nothing at all whatsoever even vaguely had happened in basically forever, and he was getting cold and tired of standing, he finally sat beside Stria and ruminated all of the food he'd eaten.</p>
		
		<p>Let Stria know that her black-and-white doe friend (Sloane) was awake. Stria and S. left to greet her and stone moved a bit closer to Red and, by proxy, Saosin. Cold now, he curled for warmth and fell asleep. Rhona joined them at some point and that was cool. Stone eventually got to wondering why Stria was taking so long, so he went to awkwardly stand by her, S., Sloane, and Rajani. Nothing happened, so he came back to the group. However, Talla was now sitting up near Red, Saosin, and Rhona, so he gave space because he didn't want to be rude. It was, however, not enough space, so she left and he settled beside them again. Growing bored, he gathered some small stones and even a few twigs and more solid seeds and sat stacking them, occupying himself. Ended up falling asleep again and returning to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch Forest, near Red Hill. Roamed around looking for friendly faces, but literally everyone but himself and another were asleep. Luckily, that other (Cole), though a stranger, was sitting beside Ross, who stone readily recognized. On the way to check on them, another (Arceleon) awoke and stone went to meet them. They seemed flighty, however, so stone gave up. Being more confident now that he could easily defend himself, he neared Cole and Ross and grazed while watching to see if they would rouse. Arceleon actually seemed to follow and wandered nearby for some time before apparently losing interest. Cole did stand, but seemed to take a defensive posture to protect Ross from the newcomer. Stone left, returned, and left again, moving here and there to graze different plants.</p>
		
		<p>Sensed Alain, who he recalled as being Stria's ally during The Rut. Happy to finally feel a familiar face (even if he had only met him as many times as Ross&mdash;once&mdash;lol), he ventured over to greet him right away. Delightfully, Alain somehow recalled him, and they greeted as if no time had passed. Alain then seemed to invite him to sit, but stone in his typical awkward fashion stood for a long while before he followed through. finally settling, he hardly noticed when the ever-silent Red took his other side. They bumped one-another in the closest thing to a fist-bump deer are capable of. Then Åsleif joined and stone actually stood to greet her (rude, stone). Then Rhona, who stone had not seen in a long while and who she doubted would remember him. Red and stone lavished the pregnant Åsleif in attention for a while. Stone noticed a familiar fawn (S.) lingering on the horizon and invited it to join them. They all bundled together for some time until a wolf-pup ([TheSniper] Pictogram) showed up. The more open-minded youngsters (Rhona and S.) immediately took to him and stone watched it :\-ly but didn't act on anything. Did stand a bit closer to the sleeping Alain, however, to demonstrate that he'd be watchful. The Red had entirely moved away by this point due to the canine.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually things settled. He was cozied up to Åsleif when S. and, unfortunately, the pup joined them. At least the canine wasn't touching him. Somehow, hardly noticed when the very-pregnant Kauna joined them, Khona flocking to her. They all lumped in warmth together, stone classily chewing his cud in Åsleif's ear. Eventually, stone went to check on Red. Deciding that he was comfortable, just politely protesting the wolf, stone left him and returned to the WARMTH PILE. Fell asleep there and returned to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest. Immediately sensed Saosin and knew that if The Red was around, he'd be near. Went to them, and was rewarded for his conclusion. Greeted both with measured degrees of joy based on closeness. They did Saosin-Red things for a bit and stone sat down, realizing that a resting and very pregnant María was nearby, he turned his attention to her for a time, but left her space. He eventually got up to meet the bright Eventide, thinking him no more strange than Stria and thus good. However, everything changed when the fawn attacked!</p>
		
		<p>The Inferno and The Red were now Ruuning and cowering from a tiny thing, Grímkell, who hardly seemed spooky on his own. Stone realized it must be a game, and joined in as soon as he felt welcome to. And so four full-grown stags ran from a dot for quite a while, eventually banding together to approach and appease him. They all settled and received nuzzles, and it was good.</p>
		
		<p>Sitting in good company, and more tired from the play than he wanted to admit, he soon fell asleep and returned to The Dark Place in high spirits.</p>

			<h3><time datetime="2016-1-17">January 17, 2016</time></h3>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest, aware of only one thing: he was itchy. Itchier than he felt he had even been, though he knew better. Evidently, his velvet was ready to come off, and actually had been for some time, despite his earlier venture through Limbo. Why this had not been completed for him whilst he was in The Dark Place, he did not know. It had been last year. No matter the mystery, he couldn't very well simply lie back down and leave. What if his velvet never came off and when he woke up again something terrible had happened because of it? He had never seen a stag refuse to rub off his velvet (who would do such a thing&#8253;) and was anxious thinking about what might result from that.</p>
		
		<p>So in The Forest he'd stay.</p>
		
		<p>He did not start off looking for others, though that would have been a sensible thing to do, as they could help. In fact, he was so distracted by just how itchy he was that he virtually ignored everyone else and set about finding the best things to rub on, which is not a good idea when you are a prey animal in The Endless Forest, but no one had technically ever actually attacked him, so whatever. It'd probably be fine.</p>
		
		<p>Much to his horror, his velvet was drier than usual, and while decidedly less bloody and unpleasant, it was also sticking with more gusto. This called for extreme rubbing.</p>
		
		<p>Returned to his scrape near the stream first, desperately scratching his antlers with the tree, wondering how dead skin over bone could possibly be so itchy. It didn't seem natural or normal, and yet here he was, with the compulsion.</p>
		
		<p>While it was not strictly warm out, he deemed it worthwhile to stand with his head under the Crying Idol for some time in an effort to moisten the skin once more, hoping that would make it easier to slough off.</p>
		
		<p>After trying some more rubbing, concluded that searching for help might be quickest, and somewhat haphazardly stumbled across Stria, who was sitting fairly near a <em>very</em> large group, and herself was in the company of Rohit and (iichiko). Discovered, upon nearing the group, that they were not so much near a large group, but in the distant proximity of many small clusters which all happened to be gathered in roughly the same area of Forest. Despite the probable mix of company, stone felt quite reassured being near so many others, perhaps now back to his more confident state with his antlers utterly solid. He was particularly struck by Rohit, who seemed at once exotic and familiar (he's part Eld's you derp), and who brought him joy simply by existing, which he was not accustomed to feeling for strangers. Felt rather comfortable near the group and settled to graze just outside their general circle. Paused on and off to watch two deer&mdash;one young and one old&mdash;play. While it was not his own season for such things anymore, he did really love when birthing came around. Things were always so peaceful then, and there was plenty.</p>
		
		<p>While he grazed, waiting more patiently than he thought himself capable for Stria to snap out of the stupor she was apparently still caught in (the soak had really helped with the itching), a fog settled over the Forest, and stone was content with this as well. The humidity would help to keep his velvet more supple while it shed. Then, as if awoken by the mist, Stria got to her hooves and came to greet him. He immediately and unabashedly asked for help, and she provided it by chewing on his antlers. Nothing is more effective than a hungry Stria with a craving for flesh and blood.</p>
		
		<p>Some time later, his antlers were perhaps the cleanest thing in The Forest but for a lot of deer spit and perhaps some stray shreds of flesh here and there. Knowing complete relief, he groomed Stria in a gesture of gratitude while they talked about her recent goings-on. He also eyed Rohit totally not creepily because look at that guy, he's great, perfect; love that guy, known him for years. 10/10 that is one great dude. (Stone I swear to Christ.)</p>
		
		<p>He ended up redacting a previous statement he'd given to Stria that all who die and come back are bad, and that maybe they are not bad. Maybe. He went on to add, "[...] don't be like me. Don't abandon what could be nice just because you are afraid. I am afraid because I cannot help it, but you can." Since Stria seems torn about her feelings toward beings who she now knows to have been dead and now alive again&mdash;what she calls "death-walkers"&mdash;stone can only try to nudge her in the direction that, hopefully, leaves her feeling best, even if it is technically more dangerous. He knows Stria has good judgment, even if she seems not to sometimes. And certainly, even if she's wrong, she would make for a formidable opponent. He found himself trusting her instincts more than his own toward the death-walkers, and had grown enormously in terms of his relations with both predators and their kin, and those who are "undead," though he cannot squelch his instinct entirely.</p>
		
		<p>During the course of the conversation, stone notices Ross who has taken the side of Rohit and iichiko. He is at once intrigued by, taken with, and wary of the not-so-newcomer who he'd seen around more and more often as of late. Ross, too, notices him, and they stare at one another while stone speaks to Stria, seemingly to learn a fair amount about the other through the simple interaction.</p>
		
		<p>S., a tiny and mostly normal-looking fawn wandered up to the group, and Ross loved him immediately. They played for some time before the fawn settled beside Åsleif, who stone was delighted to see, and pleasantly regarded her pregnancy. Ross stood guard because he's a good guy.</p>
		
		<p>Stone, having the best evening he's had in some time, despite having to admit he'd been wrong, finally got to asking Stria about where she'd been. "Else." Of course. Who didn't know that. She elaborated to him what it was like, and he was at once disappointed and relieved to find that she had not been to his home&mdash;disappointed because he wanted something, anything, of it back; relieved because he could never forgive himself if it had been his world which had hurt her.</p>
		
		<p>Admitted to her in a vague way his fears that he was wrong in putting up walls against those who he thought could be dangerous, and his fears that he might never be able to change himself. But, he realized, change could not happen all at once, and it shouldn't. He'd seen how Jyoti acted, like he was suddenly different. No one could do that. Change happened slowly, if at all, and anything else was fake. A lie, to make others like you and trust you. So it was okay that he was slow, good even. That made it honest.</p>
		
		<p>He responded to Stria, who did not seem to fully follow him, when he noticed none other than H. cresting the horizon. Nudging Stria with too much excited force, he bounded to greet her, showing off his HOT RACK and rubbing all over her multi-purposely.</p>
		
		<p>He let mother and daughter bond, bumping them occasionally to leech warmth. Eventually, Stria challenged him to a spar, clearly eager to show her mother what she'd learned, how strong she was now. But in her eyes, stone saw doubt, and so he decided to take the fall. H. probably wouldn't fall for it, but it would be celebrated nonetheless. The play-fight was valiant, and actually escalated when Stria became frustrated. Stone relented, admittedly not fully due to his plan to, and H. congratulated her daughter before they began their own spar. Stone, watching two COMPLETE GIANTS VIOLENTLY COLLIDE, promptly got the FUCK OUT. He took this time to finally greet Åsleif, who he had been beyond eager to greet for some time but hadn't gotten to. He was apprehensive, not certain she'd remember him. When she approached, he expected a polite sniff, but she greeted him with a shoulder nibble and he was ecstatic. He groomed her quite delicately but passionately, while also poking at her to learn about her pregnancy. Rohit stood and stone watched him eagerly, wanting to go and meet him but not wanting to seem over-eager or otherwise overwhelming. However, Rohit promptly trotted off, leaving stone momentarily in despair. However, stone had a feeling he'd be seeing him again, so he came out of it in but a moment.</p>
		
		<p>Sat at Åsleif's side when she settled, likely to rest. He was then joined by the mother-daughter duo and, for the first time in the Forest for so long, he was finally warm. Everything was perfect. Åsleif dozed, Ross dozing but a pace away. Stone was already fond of the being. H. and Stria continued to search stone's antlers for missing shreds of velvet, but Stria had done an awfully good job. Stone lay his head on whomever was most convenient and dozed, staying in The Forest, desperate in a rare way to never leave this moment.</p>
		
		<p>Was rudely awakened by a mask spell. Irately lifted his head to see who was responsible, only to find H. and Stria mischievously looking down at him. Apparently, he'd been indoctrinated into their weird mask club. (Got random cast: Space Beluga Mask. Beloved commented that he likes this one because it most reminds him of a human skull. Especially because Stria and H. had "dug the mask out of the Graveyard," the irony was too great and that is canon. It does not alter his face at all [because wtf that would be horrifying] but it is a human skull stuck on his face. Though he'd somewhat always been, he supposed he was now fully indoctrinated into their weird family. Dozed some more.</p>
		
		<p>Awoke as H. slipped off. Wished her well. Dozed even more. While he dozed, the sun came out again, and the fog lifted. Eventually, slipped off himself.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest, in Limbo. Wandered around a little, enjoying the warmth and the lack of aches. Wasn't heartbroken that he couldn't find his way to the Forest as it usually was, but was a bit confused as to why he was in Limbo in the first place. Wondered at his antlers which were still covered in velvet&mdash;he felt they shouldn't be, but he wasn't uncomfortable, so he let them be. Eventually just lay down and went back to The Dark Place because why not. (When you don't have hte connection.)</p>

		<p>Awoke, near the tiger den, in Limbo. Admired the sun. Wandered but didn't stray too far. Waited to find his way back to the usual Forest, half hoping it wouldn't take him and that he could stay here, pain free, warm in sunlight, free of all predators.</p>
		
		<p>Laid down and pretended to sleep, as he usually had to do when it wasn't letting him come. Watched fog bloom around him and heard hoof-beats in the distance. Apparently, he was here.</p>
		
		<p>And so was Stria. He went to her. She was with Sloane, who was still somewhat off-putting despite her clearly good intentions. He simply stood by non-threateningly until Stria came to him. They groomed.</p>
		
		<p>Having entirely ignored the giant flowers up until now, he looked at them and the massive mushrooms and wondered why the Forest was so fucked up.</p>
		
		<p>Stria was clearly still distancing herself from the world in an attempt to protect herself from feeling too much. As she slowly surfaced once more, stone invited her to help him knock down a mushroom for the hell of it. He often found that purposeless physical exertion helped him through emotional strain.</p>
		
		<p>They won because Stria is a tank. They ate as much as they physically could. (Note that I'm a fuckass and headcanon there are more than just <em>Amanita muscaria</em> because it would be lame if it was just one sort that wasn't even food.</p>
		
		<p>Stria wandered off to fetch her stuffed tiger to show him. He booped it and mocked fear to make fun of himself, ultimately ending up booping it in approval before suggesting that it would be better (and smell better/less like tigers) with berries, to make fun of her. He was definitely more in the mood for humour and fun than she.</p>
		
		<p>Followed her back over near Sloane to their fallen mushroom and nestled beside her when she settled to chew on it some more. Full himself, simply chew hid cud. Eventually settled and went off to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Oak. Sensed Stria and Rune right away and sprinted to them. The candles were gone anyway so there was nothing to stay for. They were near the tiger den but he didn't care because they were here and he was freezing. He shoved himself up to the two of them and chit-chatted at them unimportantly. Regaled them with tales of his past as he was prone to doing, such as:</p>
		
		<p><em>"I remember this particular winter it was colder than usual, though there was never snow or anything like this, just a little chill. Well, my mother and I&mdash;she was an old doe by then and I hardly knew who she was, though I know now&mdash;we and the herd travelled down to the phumdis because the plants were always a lot warmer. You should have seen it, almost two hundred deer it must have been, just scattered around this floating bunch of grass. It was really something."</em></p>
		
		<p>Fell asleep on and off, as he was prone to. Greatly enjoyed their warmth and their company. Felt better than he had in a long while.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually fell asleep for a long bout. Fully at peace, stone drifted off to The Dark Place a while afterwards.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, on the bridge. Was fully brought to by the distinct bite to the air and cold spots settling on him. Ah, snow. Irritated, he stood, happy the candles were still there. It was full-fledged night, and the snow was coming down moderately heavy. Despite the fact that he was already terribly cold, it was beautiful. But he needed to look for something better.</p>
		
		<p>He started off sprinting through the Forest, ignoring his screaming joints which cried for rest and warmth. The Ruins held more candles, but smaller. They weren't sufficient. The Playground was not much better, though he did bask there to recuperate. He had passed the Old Oak and its awful humming on his way to the Ruins, and it virtually promised warmth. He hated that place, but&hellip; He'd just trot by, he wouldn't stay, only if there was a candle in there would he stay.</p>
		
		<p>Trotting by the Oak, he peered in, and was greeted by the sight of a large candle. Squinting, he entered the Oak.</p>
		
		<p>And so that is how stone came to be sitting inside of the Old Oak looking extremely grumpy. But warm. He remained there for some time, watching being run by outside occasionally, contemplating the utterly all-encompassing hum.</p>
		
		<p>Dozed on and off but remained in the Forest out of a desire to see someone he knew. Unknowingly, the Red was only a dash away for a couple of hours while he sat idly, dozing and chewing cud and attempting to balance fallen twigs. (The sound of Red living up to stone's experience of never having been able to find him.) However, thankfully, sometime later, The Red came to <em>him</em> and they bounced about like morons for a moment before stone realized that Red? Had candles? On his antlers? Was utterly baffled by this but didn't connect it to magic in the slightest. In fact, overlooked the fact that they drew attention to him entirely and was extremely excited by the fact they could thus obviously be moved. Portable warmth sticks? It's more likely than you think. Rubbed on him some and booped him to check his general health. Sensing he was generally well, they proceeded with a stranger back into the remarkably non-peaceful Oak.</p>
		
		<p>The Red seemed to doze while a fawn then another stranger joined them. The stranger cast a few pelt spells, both The Red and stone falling victim to him. Ironically, stone had his own pelt spell cast upon him, and was deeply disturbed because he seemed to <em>look</em> normal, but was clearly covered in Magic. What with it being below freezing, a cleansing rinse in the Pond was out of the question, no matter how warm the spring that was its source was. Moving out of view from the others, he finally relied upon sneezing, which still also disturbed him to some extent, but it seemed to do the trick. He entered the Oak once more and joined his friend, enjoying the warmth together, and thinking on the Oak itself. While sitting, he realized he was starting to feel that familiar itch along his velvet. It seemed so soon, but he'd clearly just been gone for a long time.</p>
		
		<p>Red moved off some time later but stone did not notice in time. At peace knowing at least one of his friends was well, stone allowed himself to return to The Dark Place for the time being.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Blue Bowl. Was momentarily disoriented. While he always came back to the Forest from The Dark Place due to a wish to return, it was sometimes less conscious than others. In this case, it was concern about Stria and his other loved ones, particularly The Red and Rune, as well as the ladies he'd come to consider a semi-constant semi-platonic harem of his. He felt guilty for being gone as long as he knew he had, but he knew what he was like. Still, he should see how they were doing.</p>
		
		<p>Was grumbly due to the cold. He could sense no one of whom he both knew and felt friendly toward. A little gathering nearby (Heiðrún, Mjölnir, Morgen, Víðarr) caught his attention and charmed him, despite their weird faces. He stood nearby with the odd desire to see that they remained safe, but he realized that they would not view him as any more friendly than another stranger, and not wanting to cause trouble, he moved on.</p>
		
		<p>It was only then that he really noticed the differences&mdash;namely, the twilight, giant mushrooms, and giant candles. He was pretty ticked off by the candles (not the mushrooms, just the candles) until he ventured to the Pond. Attempting to cross the bridge, he realized they emitted heat and they became his best friend. While sitting there, he became aware of the being in the water who he'd witnessed before (Nyami). He spent some time peering over the edge of the bridge (also being quite impressed by its architecture, as he'd never spent any significant period of time around it), but she did not seem to notice him. Perhaps she was sleeping&mdash;he couldn't see her so well from the distance.</p>
		
		<p>Grew bored without company. Not yet hungry due to his time spent in The Dark Place, he had no desire to eat or drink. It was too cold to bathe, and he did not want to stray far from the huddle of candles to collect stones for cairn building. He built a few out of loose pebbles from the bridge itself, but it was eerily well-constructed and did not have many loose parts so he ran out quickly. While sitting there contemplating if he should merely leave, he noticed a pair of deer Ruuning about and generally being boisterous. Wanted to ensure the safety of the aforementioned group&mdash;though he could not quite pinpoint why and thought himself rather foolish for caring&mdash;so he went to stand between the pair and the group. Nothing came of it&mdash;the pair increased the distance without incident, though he watched one blow a bubble and found himself troubled by it.</p>
		
		<p>Decided to return to the bridge because they seemed harmless and it was cold as fuck. Ended up falling asleep, lulled by the warmth of the candles, and returned to The Dark Place having done nothing of interest.</p>

		<p>Awoke, near the Crying Idol. Sought out Stria who was around the tiger family's den. She met him on his way over and they stood, then sat with one another, both clearly entirely dissatisfied with the snow but for different reasons. Was kept from becoming dangerously cold by her enormous body mass and thick fur (bless ur warmth bae).</p>
		
		<p>Nudged her after some time and led them to the Blue Bowl, his first choice (the Playground) currently being occupied by some sort of predator (Romulus). The nestled together in the blueberry bushes, stone sleeping on and off, as close as physically possible to Stria to steal her warmth. Ate on and off too, ruminating and just generally huddling away from the snow as best as he could. Snow 0/10 do not recommend.</p>
		
		<p>Ended up returning to The Dark Place a long while afterward.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest. Arose to seek out Stria, who was with Shahla. As he approached, he noticed that Stria was very apprehensive, and Shahla was staring down what looked to be a relative of hers (Jyoti). Still in a post-panic-attack state of Zen, he could not have cared less, and merely flitted about grazing and returning to Stria.</p>
		
		<p>He grew bored of the situation and went to investigate a new face who interested him (the feral mule deer, username Summit), but discovered them to have vanished after he became distracted. Returned to Stria and stood with her what felt like <em>forever</em> catching snippets of the conversation between Shahla and Jyoti, thankful to not be involved in the family drama. Eventually, Jyoti left. Stria went to Shahla for comfort or some other reason while stone continued sitting. Stria returned to him, Shahla bowed politely before leaving, which stone found charming. Perhaps they could get along yet. Stria seemed tired and sat, so stone sat beside her, licking at her fur here and there, fixing cowlicks and other such imperfections.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually, having calmed himself after grooming her for far too long, stone lay his head upon her back, and fell asleep. He returned to The Dark Place.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, near the Pond. Immediately sensed a sleeping Rhiannon and settled beside her. Not long after, jerked to his hooves when he felt Stria, on the move and alone, clearly not a recent addition to the Forest's current population. Galloped to her, feeling guilty for not looking for her first.</p>
		
		<p>Noticed right away that she was pretty fucked up. Did his best to comfort her, but she seemed almost entirely disassociated.</p>
		
		<p>Followed her back to Sloane, Lobo, and username iichiko&mdash;all of whom were asleep. Sniffed the group briefly before being spooked off, but doubled back to Stria to stay with her, despite his apprehension. Draped himself over her as best as he could reach to watch the group, just in case. Stood with her a long time, long enough for his joints to hurt.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually decided to fetch her some food since she hadn't eaten in front of him yet and he found that alarming. On top of that, it had worked for everyone else when they were doing poorly, so it was worth a try. He decided that mushrooms would be the best approach, despite the awful spell that accompanied them. Once he finally found a tree (I was beginning to worry that Starless had gotten to all of them), he had to gather himself for some time before he was ready to collect the mushrooms. Finally resigning himself to it, he did so and found his way back to Stria with a grimace. Or, he would have, but Sloane had awoken and was seated at her side. Tried his darndest to continue, but realized with mixed emotions that he was too afraid to approach.</p>
		
		<p>Getting progressively more frustrated with himself, he stared at them from a distance, too self-absorbed to realize when Sloane stood and approached him, only noticing when she stood before him, sniffing at him amiably. Despite her clearly friendly nature, he was already anxious, and retreated immediately, turning circles in contention with his fear in an effort to be polite to Stria's friend. Sloane, perhaps understanding his turmoil, returned then to Stria.</p>
		
		<p>Standing with mushrooms in his mouth and an unpleasant spell ready to cast, he repeatedly circled in a cycle of approaching and withdrawing, at once motivated to deliver to mushrooms and join his companion, and to flee from that which his instincts insisted was a threat. Sloane, in one of the kindest displays stone had ever witnessed, retreated even further, leaving Stria momentarily alone. Stone realized two important things then: firstly, Sloane was specifically trying to make him feel comfortable; and secondly, he was still afraid, and he hated himself for it. Taking the opportunity presented to him, he rushed in, dropped the mushrooms before Stria, and rushed away.</p>
		
		<p>Progressively grew more and more anxious, angry, and otherwise upset, eventually becoming utterly disgusted with himself. Retreated to a tree where he experienced his first human-like panic attack. His existential crises was fueled not only by his current body-mind division, but also earlier failings (largely about his relationship with Stria) as well. Consumed entirely with self-loathing, he exerted his frustrations with himself on an innocent tree, perhaps doing some damage to his own antler development in the process. Eventually he settled into the tree, trying to cease to exist, trying to simply crawl inside of it and stop. For a long time he sat and wanted to just be at her side and safe and know she was as well, but he remained too afraid to try.</p>
		
		<p>Gathering motivation not from courage, but simply from the disgust he felt with himself, he approached the pair (iichiko having long since departed, and Lobo still being asleep off on its own). Not realizing Sloane was asleep, not caring even if he had, he continued the approach-retreat circling and frustrated stomping that he'd exhibited earlier, entirely fed-up with his own terror. After a very long bout of this, he finally reached Stria's side and plummeted into her. She leaned into him, the most consolation she was then capable of, but he had already mentally withdrawn in a very similar way to her, completely exhausted by his internal rift. He stayed awake for a long time, burrowed into her as best as he could, but eventually succumbed to sleep after Sloane had gone somewhere, he didn't know. Stria sat awake, ever awake, the mushrooms long gone, seeming only a ghost of herself.</p>
		
		<p>Wanting to leave, but not wanting to leave her, he fought his inclination to return to the safety of The Dark Place, leaving him still yet worse for wear. But he could not bring himself to leave her, not as things were.</p>
		
		<p>Slept on and off by her side. Didn't sit up when he was awake. A long time later, noticed Lobo staring at them both. Wondered why it was staring at them. It was too small to be frightening. Even if it was larger, he no longer had the energy to be afraid. Instead, he was curious about it, so he stood to sniff at it, though by then it was clearly nodding off. Stria stood to stand beside stone, and they remained that way, each facing another direction. Stone watched the hybridized puppy, contemplated how easy it would be to take its life. It was not his nature, not because it was cruel or otherwise; he was intelligent, and his instinct to dispatch potential future threats was overridden by his awareness that their relatives tended to seek vengeance and, if befriended early on, they could become valuable allies and assets within their own predatory social circles. So he took no action against Lobo, though he did not like the pup and he did not care for it. He could pretend to. And he knew, in a better mood, like all the other strange beings he'd come to feel affection for here, he could come to love him&mdash;though it was impossible to imagine.</p>
		
		<p>While in this unique mindset of feeling no fear, stone realized that he didn't care for <em>this</em> either, and no longer felt the self-hatred he had been through earlier. After all, the anxiety, the terror, the constant state of nervous vigilance, it was just him trying to protect himself. He was just trying to stay alive. Whether he was right or wrong, it was the instinct that had gotten him this far. He couldn't be faulted for it. He couldn't fault himself for it. Though he was also somewhat hardened toward any emotions, his guilt evaporated, at least in regards to himself. He'd always have abandoned Stria out of his own self-interest, but it was okay for him to be afraid. And things had turned out alright so far. He watched Lobo sleep.</p>
		
		<p>When Stria settled, he settled, and when he did, he felt at peace enough to return to The Dark Place.</p>can't

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch Forest. Found and went to Stria, who was sleeping. Slept by her for a long while. When he awoke, she was no longer in the Forest. Disappointed, he searched for anyone else he knew. He scented kin of Shahla and Kio, a young fawn-cub, presumably somehow borne of them. Curiosity overpowered him and he went to see her, but she was in the tiger's den-area protected by another, sleeping being who he could not identify at a glance and did not stick around long enough to try to figure out.</p>
		
		<p>He wandered, peeking around at those who were alone to see if he would like their company and they would like his. Suddenly, however, there was dozens of glowing things flying over the hyacinths. They looked like the Glowing Names&mdash;the Pictograms, he remembered having learned. Magic told him they were fireflies, but he did not really care. They were, however, beautiful and lovely, and he stood under them for an untold time just watching them, ignoring the Forest around him altogether, like he was a fawn again.</p>
		
		<p>Sensed Rune passively. Immediately jerked from his firefly-inspired reverie and booked it to the young roe stag. They hung out and didn't do much, as is habit. Stone watched deer pass by.</p>
		
		<p>Stone led them to the Pond where they played and stone ate and drank a tad. They sat overlooking the Pond, <a href="https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/40679435_JEbv7GURGYNaL0K.png?1692073038" target="_blank">sleeping on and off</a>. They were joined by Rhiannon, who seemed upset. Stone, in his typical charming fashion, licked her face but otherwise let her be and snugged with the two of them. She eventually left as she came, and stone&mdash;too comfortable next to the warm roe&mdash;went off to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in a blueberry bush. Noted the rain but didn't feel one way or the other about it, though he was already a bit cold. Snacked before he even stood up because he has his priorities straight. Glance up and saw a unicorn??? Squinted but decided against perusing the oddity. It didn't seem like it was there for him anyway, though it did give him an odd look, like it could not only see him but see into him. Brushed it off with a large bite of cool berries and leaves.</p>
		
		<p>Got to his hooves to greet a stranger, though they eventually lost interest. Sensed the sambar doe out in the Forest and trot-ran to find her, eager for company, particularly her company. Joined her in a more feral way than he'd become accustomed. Stood watch while she grazed and followed her to a different place after a stranger kept approaching them. Hung out, eventually wanting to lie down but not wanting to seem inattentive. Was actually happy when the rain let up, it was too cold to be wet. Delighted with the twilight, crepuscular creature that he is.</p>
		
		<p>Then Stria was there, sneakier than any animal that size has a right to be. He rushed to greet her and the sambar followed. Stria seemed aloof toward her but stone could not for the life of him remember why. When the sambar paid attention to Stria alone that seemed to ease much of her grumpiness. Stone then initiated mild play because nothing drags Stria out of her own head better than romping about and he knows it. They eventually settled together in some grasses that stone led them to. Not long after, they were very suddenly joined by Rune, and stone flipped his shit in a very grown-up way. After booping the roe quite a lot, he and Stria ran about and were noodly. Stone could not help but join in, and the sambar, surrounded by sprinting and leaping deer, was taken up in the mood as well. Rune and Stria settled together&mdash;surely with Stria crushing Rune with her enormous girth&mdash;while stone stood with the sambar. Growing drowsy, he settled and found himself in The Dark Place once more. (Work needs to stop interfering with my vastly more important pixel deer pretend games.)</p>

		<p>Awoke, In the Birch Forest. Wandered, half looking for company but not expecting it, drifting virtually aimlessly. Feeling a bit low, wasn't much participating in life.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually sensed Rhiannon. Went to see her, but she was asleep, and being watched by Shardul. Unaware that they knew each other, he stood by to be certain that things were alright. (Then I minimized because I am excellent.) Eventually, she awakened and paid heed to him. Considering the mood, stone vacated and sat in a blueberry bush some distance away. Luckily, she eventually came to join him, which lightened his mood but not enough for him to show it.</p>
		
		<p>Being an old fart, he ended up falling asleep and drifting off to The Dark Place anyway. (I had work the following day. ): )</p>

		<p>Awoke, on Red Hill. Promptly got up to find Stria. She was where the tigers tend to be, wearing a skull on her face. Looked around for her mother, wondering if they'd had some sort of get-together. Hung around with her. They went to the Pond to drink, and went on a walk, and ate a ton in the Blue Bowl, and did things one would expect. Stria has taken to leaning quite forcefully on those around her, but given that she's about three times his weight, this is a problem. He will eventually topple, but held out well across the day.</p>
		
		<p>With her help, he sought out a nice hiding patch to bed down with her. They were joined by The Red, who seemed not quite himself but not odd enough to fret over just yet. Stone eventually fell asleep and went off to The Dark Place.</p>

Bedded down in a nice bunch of grass nearby, waiting for her to leave Kio and join him instead (lmao how presumptuous). She did. They groomed, he tended to what remained of her wounds, they generally existed as deer, were pretty cool, eh sat there and doesn’t afraid of anything, etc.</p>
		
		<p>They eventually moved for reasons, and went to the Pond to drink and eat for reasons. Then stone sat down and no one was surprised. He proceeded to consume every water plant around him. He ruminated for some time and then fell asleep, drifting back off to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Kind of. Found a nice patch of grass in the grassy knoll by De Drinkplaats and sat and ruminated a while. Was feeling much better after having spent a few days in The Dark Place healing.</p>
		
		<p>Re-awoke and joined Stria and The Red, who were looming over him ruminating, for a long while. Eventually went off to refresh his scrapes and was followed by Stria, who attempted to start her own. (Little late, baby.) Ended up telling someone off (username lenanik) who he perceived to be pestering Stria. Fought briefly, though did not engage enough to sustain notable injuries. Left it.</p>
		
		<p>Wandered around with Stria somewhat aimlessly, roaring and making a big deal of himself, but going unnoticed by judges and unchallenged by competitors or challengers. Separated from Stria a little and rejoined her on Red Hill, where she was hanging around with Trees. Though stone was happy to see her again, for whatever reason, he did not engage with her, instead jumping right into the "standing guard" stage of holding "his harem" (stone u didn't even try to impress her this isn't your harem???????). Ended up just standing around a while because there was just no one to impress. (RIP me and wanting to participate in the Rut but working during its peak hours. )))))))): ) Eventually fell asleep and went back to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Pond. Immediately moved away from the being there, going to refresh all (three, lmao) of his scrapes. Noticed Swan with his immense herd, as usual. Envied him in passing. While rubbing his scrape, caught scent of a lone female (Accendare). Tried to court her, but she ended up falling asleep (ouch). Went off back to his scrape. Noticed a shape coming toward him, pausing long enough to determine that it was Rune! Greeted him, minus the usual nuzzles (that's just a rude thing to do to a stag this time of year).</p>
		
		<p>Stood for a while, hoping for judges. When there was no trace of any who were not in a herd, stone went to refresh his other two scrapes, hoping something would just happen. Nothing did. Stopped at stared at Swan's harem for a while, thinking he might step away or one might grow bored. Ended up disliking the chanciness of it, and simply returned to Accendare in hopes that she would notice him.</p>
		
		<p>Then Rhia showed up! Was giddy with the fact that at least <em>one</em> female might join him. She seemed quite fond of Rune and that was fine, all the more reason for her to stay, considering the roe's loyalty. She then approached Accendare, who actually STOOD UP? Stone, Rune, and Rhia all sniffed at her, but she next did respond to stone. Eh, no "no" is a maybe. He ended up setting up shop, so to speak, right there, roaring and proclaiming the area as his until it was contested. He went about grooming Rhia, marking her right away, to reinforce her presence. And then Lucchaine showed up. c: Accendare stood to greet him and stone went about rounding up Rune because absolutely not. Rhia, however, stayed behind.</p>
		
		<p>Got a bit away before realizing she was not with them. Turned to watch her, nearly heartbroken, and actually made his way back to nuzzle-mark her, as if somehow that would help. Lucchaine was clearly not pleased about the entire thing, and stone didn't wait around to find out what his fighting style was.</p>
		
		<p>Thankfully, Rhia caught up moments afterward, apparently not impressed enough to stay. They made their way, Rhiannon leading, to a fine spot in the First Forest, near the Pond and Old Oak. Rhia settled, Rune bouncing about and being Rune-ish, while stone set about gathering mushrooms and pine cones for Rhia to snack on, if she so chose. More specifically, it was to make her <em>look</em> like she was snacking on them, because even though she was most definitely a predator, and stone did not know if she even <em>could</em> eat non-meat, it would put any other possible judges at ease. And, like a miracle, other judges there were. The feral Formosan sika deer and a new face, a feral sambar hind, made their way toward him from the Birch. Moments after, another lovely face, a doe known as Anja, emerged as well. Stone set about impressing the three as best as he could while Rune sniffed and greeted them. Anja seemed distant and relatively uninterested, but he had to try. He ended up allowing her space, so long as she stayed nearby.</p>
		
		<p>Before cementing his status with the feral does, he returned to Rhia (who they did not seem thrilled about) to offer her more food, incentive for her to stay and for the others not to be afraid. He knew Rhia preferred to be in smaller groups, and this might not be her deal, so he tried his best to accommodate her. Thankfully, she seemed to be feeling particularly amiable, and made no move to leave or convince the others to.</p>
		
		<p>Returned to the ladies, sniffs all around. Nuzzled/marked the sika, but was politely distancing himself from the sambar until she made her choice. He did not want to come off as too forceful and frighten her off. However, anything but an honourable gentleman, he slid over to Rune and asked a favour. Taking one for the team, Rune stood up and the two "fought," entirely staged of course, and "defeated" the "threat." Rune faux-sulked to himself, stone whispering his gratitude and something about "owing him one," before returning to the impressed hinds, finally nuzzling the sambar. What a sneaky ploy. Felt a little bad for being so underhanded, but on the other hoof, had a harem. Bounced between the sika, the sambar, and Rhia. Rhia eventually fell asleep, feeling safe and content. He spent time lavishing the ferals in attention, pausing only to follow Anja briefly in an attempt to get her to stay, but he quickly gave up on it, realizing she wasn't interested.</p>
		
		<p>Invited Rune back, within his harem, trying to impress the ladies further by showing "what a good guy he was" by "protecting" the "loser" while he was "vulnerable." (Pls.) Marked every tree in the area. Peed and rolled in it. Roared a lot. Bounced around. Was generally macho. Reopened his wound and utterly ignored it.</p>
		
		<p>The sambar led them to drink, and stone stood watch while the ladies did so, not even hinting that he was hungry or thirsty (which he was), because it would look bad. They then moved as a herd into the Birch, near the playground, where they herded about for some time. Stone at many points grew wary of a nearby harem, but after scenting its members, was no longer impressed. Stria joined them for a grooming pile, smelling like tiger and recent fight (oh, Stria, you're so brave, fighting that tiger! yeah...) stone had not sat down for hours and was starting to feel it, but he couldn't just sit around them, so he continued to suffer in stoic silence, looking manly as heck.</p>
		
		<p>Stria left to eat or something, whatever Strias do, while stone wasn't paying attention. Nothing really changed and a lot of time passed. Stone started strutting and roaring and showing off again, which spurred some play (intense by feral standards but mild by Forest standards). They then settled back into their pile, stone lavishing them both as well as he could. Then Stria showed up. With Circe and Yoko. Both of the hinds BOOKED IT while stone faced Circe directly, approaching in confrontation. Stria looked confused and distraught. Yoko looked confused and tried to be polite with many bows and such, but stone was too distracted to be polite. Yoko soon decided to vacate, which was a good choice. Circe left for whatever reason, and while stone was join to lecture Stria on bringing predators to the herd (stone, you literally had a predator to begin with, you didn't make her not a predator by feeding her mushrooms and pine cones???????), Stria followed. Wanted to talk to her, but had to attend to the does. Found them toward Red Hill, and admittedly may have played it up a bit by being unharmed (by the tiger) and relatively stress-free about it. Settled back into their routine. Eventually, the sika had to go. Stone tried his best, but he ended up needing to sit down before he went down, and so he ventured into the grassiest part of the Birch than he knew, and thankfully the sambar followed. He found a very nice hiding patch of grass, and they sat together for a long time, even after he fell asleep.</p>
		
		<p>Awoke after about twenty minutes of dead sleep (long for a deer). Moved a bit to be touching the sambar more. Otherwise, just sat, dozing but not really sleeping. They stayed together resting for a few hours before she eventually left.</p>
		
		<p>Got up and limped off to find Stria. Naturally, she was still with Circe. Looked within himself to see how he felt, and determined that he didn't feel much of anything. He doubted strongly that Stria had brought the half-tiger along for any malicious reason. After all, despite her behaviour, she wasn't stupid; she knew feral deer didn't like predators, and she seemed to greatly enjoy the attention that was lavished upon her by the other hinds, so why would she intentionally spoil that for herself? Chances are, she'd simply not been thinking. And, had it been just her and Yoko, or had Circe been completely bongo, stone would have welcomed them eagerly. It seemed that her perspective was just grossly distorted by growing up in such a messed up place, and who could blame her? Stone couldn't. She seemed very upset, tired and troubled, and so for a while he groomed her like he had been with his harem. He led her to the Pond where he chewed willow bark for her shoulder wounds, a trick he'd picked up from Red, and for once not Magic.</p>
		
		<p>Proving that their relationship had changed, for the better, he was completely honest with her and told her he needed to sit down. She seemed cooperative yet displeased, and so he limped to the blueberry bushes just behind the Crying Idol, where he virtually fell into one and ate at his leisure, lying on his side, taking of mouthfuls of leaves, twigs, berries, and all. He'd already lost some weight, and he'd definitively done himself in today, so he needed to care for himself a bit before things heated up again.</p>
		
		<p>Slept on and off for hours, Stria staying awake most of the time. Barely chewed his cud before falling asleep, so felt kind of weird. Ended up ruminating for some time in his sleeping position. Eventually lifted his head, determining that he was going to go off to The Dark Place soon. Asked Stria if she'd like a walk back to Circe before he left. She declined, but seemed pleased about something of the offer, though still distinctly distant. He waited to fall asleep. When he did, he went off to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, near the Birch. Moved to Red Hill to refresh a scrape, but didn't have much in him. Rested. Awoke to Saosin, Red, and a couple others. Observed them for a time but did not participate beyond greeting before returning to resting.</p>
		
		<p>Watched Red deal with a spooky (Umay), and got to his hooves in case he could be helpful. Ended up settling back down. Had a lazy afternoon. Somewhat resigned to the fact that he is not particularly impressive, with only partially-grown antlers and little experience outside of his own herd of Eld's deer. Would try again later.</p>
		
		<p>Moved to the Pond to rest there, as it seemed oddly quiet during the Rut. Drank a bit, ate and ruminated a bit. Was unknowingly observed by Shanai who was contemplating what it would be like to eat him. (Nice catch there, stone.) Ended up falling asleep and drifting off to The Dark Place.</p>

			<h3><time datetime="2015-09-27">September 27, 2015</time></h3>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest. Limped his way to the Pond and plopped unceremoniously into its waters on the shoreline, where he fell back asleep, exhausted from the walk.</p>
		
		<p>Finally hauled himself up and into the deeper waters to bathe himself. Debated resting some more briefly, but abandoned the idea. He would get any real rest, not with all these scents, all these females in estrus. He would rest when he was dead. Washed up, marked himself with fresh urine, and set about finding someone to join him.</p>
		
		<p>Side-eyed a spooky for a while as he got his bearings. Knew he ought to walk, but amped it up to a healthy trot near them to avoid leaving the opinion that he was old and weak. Slowed down considerably after distancing himself, and stopped for a breather once he was out of sight. (You idiot.)</p>
		
		<p>Found his way to Red Hill, which has become something of a social hub for him. Good things, interesting things, tend to happen to him there, and it seems safe, and high-up. Like magic, was joined almost at once by a seemingly uncertain Eth (who he admittedly scarcely recalled at first, before her scent struck him) and, much to his shock, Khuna. Much like Eth, he did not at first recognize Khuna, and so he found himself nuzzled by a stranger until he breathed in. Was at first too surprised to respond, but set about grooming her in welcome and to check on her growth and overall health. Deeming her fit as a fiddle, he offered Eth the same response to welcome and encourage her to stay for purely selfish reasons.</p>
		
		<p>They all stood about grooming and the like, but not long after, Khuna returned to wherever it is she goes. Sad but not surprised to see her go, stone resumed grooming Eth for a time, uncertain as to what was welcomed of him. It may have been his hesitance which did him in, as he withdrew when she shifted, worried he may have offended her or crossed some sort of boundary of which he was unaware. She invited him to sit, which he graciously accepted. Though he was doing his best to mask it, he was in considerable pain and his wounds needed more tending.</p>
		
		<p>Raised his head when a stranger approached. Scented her and utterly overlooked her feline ancestry, paying heed only to the fact that she seemed amiable and was clearly close to Eth, given their nuzzling. Was hesitant to greet her with anything more than a sniff, however, and ultimately lost Eth to her, leaving him alone on Red Hill once more. Sulked to himself before moving away in hopes of finding does elsewhere.</p>
		
		<p>Wandered to and fro, checking out small groups and stragglers, but it seemed that everyone who was present had already made their choices for the time being. Ended up settling in a patch of grass, hidden for safety but still obvious should any female take interest in him, near one of the larger herds he'd seen (run by the Swan Prince). Took time to judge him bitterly, wondering why there were so many damn birds in the Forest. Sulked until he fell asleep for some time, and when he awoke, they had moved on, leaving him somehow even more alone than he'd been.</p>
		
		<p>Having lost some of his enthusiasm, merely settled back down to rest, figuring perhaps he was simply too old to be appealing anymore, or too wounded, or too different.</p>
		
		<p>Awoke, to Rhiannon. Was honestly delighted to see her, despite his misgivings with their relationship. They did the greeting thing and then she led him to... Swan Prince. Not exactly his choice in company. (LMAO Y U LEAD HIM TO MY ROOM MATE'S NEW DEER DUDE.) Was not in the mood for a fight, so stood around looking nonchalant. Got included into the harem which was a blow to his pride. Stood by idly until Swan nuzzled Rhia&mdash;ay you markin' her dude? Immediately moved forward and faced Swan head-on in a challenge. Despite Rhia's goading, determined that trying to fight Swan would most likely lead to him being unable to participate in the rest of the rut. Got frustrated and simply left.</p>
		
		<p>Grumped about on Red Hill after losing yet another doe to somebody else. Re-marked his scrape in the Hill when who did he see coming but Rhia. Leading Swan's entire harem, Swan included. He... Appreciated the notion, but did not want trouble. Swan's two ladies (a SEEKRIT DEER!!! and Idelle) plopped themselves down only a bit away, and so Swan joined them, looking a bit displeased at the proximity issue. Rhia herself had settled by stone's scrape after greeting him once more, and stone stood by her, ever the attempt at a gentleman. Really he just wanted to look macho in front of judges.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually, one of Swan's group walked off, Swan himself went to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go, and Idelle followed. Rhia followed them both moments after, right after a STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS feral Formosan sika ambled up to him out of nowhere. Put on the macho front all over again, blatantly disregarding his throbbing shoulder and aching joints in favour of impressing her. Stood and groomed her after marking her at his first opportunity&mdash;welcoming her tending of his wound&mdash;for a long while, even while his body cried out for him to rest. Eventually succumbed and sat down, hoping it wouldn't hurt her impression of him and make him look like a chump. Finally took some time to chew his cud and just rest without worrying or being angry.</p>

		<p>Nodded off. Awoke to Red sulking next to the sika. Ascertained what happened by his demeanour and the fact that he was alone. Hung out together, being deerish.</p>
		
		<p>Stone sensed Stria and yelled for her. Eventually she came nearby and he roped her into joining them. The Sika hind was spooked by her but stone made an effort to get her to chill and eventually she did, for one reason or another.</p>
		
		<p>So they all deered together, three competitor/challengers and a singular judge. Totally a normal harem.</p>
		
		<p>They were joined by Åsleif, who mostly stuck with The Red and somewhat with the hinds. The all hung about for a long while, going between one another to groom and nuzzle and otherwise establish bonds and fill social demands. The Red and Stria sparred for a brief while, knowledge passing down from the elder to the younger.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually Stria went off to feed, the sika followed her, and stone felt the need to follow the sika and his companion, by extension. The hinds both fed at one of the blueberry bushes, but stone was not hungry and so simply stood watch. Eventually, Red and Åsleif made their way back. They continued deering about.</p>
		
		<p>Stria once again grew restless and led everyone to a deer she greeted, who was momentarily assimilated before leaving. Red greeted Lady Oltha before eventually settling with her.</p>
		
		<p>A short while after the sika hind settled, stone settling beside her desperate for some rest, H. showed up!!! Stood up immediately in tandem with Stria and nuzzled the heck outta her, marking her without hesitation. After thoroughly welcoming her, returned to sit with the sika while Stria and her mother reunited and sparred. Nodded off for a while. H. and Stria eventually came over to sit nearby, and he piled himself in the middle of the group, looking proud and overjoyed. He dozed some more.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually, both H. and the sika went off wherever they go, and he continued to sit with Stria until he himself went off to The Dark Place.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Went looking for a cozier patch after a while and found one. Eventually grew restless and went looking for someone to pester.</p>
		
		<p>Carefully avoided Greitai while scoping out the Forest. Eventually came across the scent of a female and traced it back to Briony. She herself seemed to be scouting out a large group consisting of a few spookies and some others (none of whom I recall). Carefully avoided them whilst trying to draw her attention and win her over. How do you look cool for girls??????</p>
		
		<p>Followed her after she ran off. Twice. After reaching the Ruins, he decided to start a scrape on one of the trees there, near enough to her to still watch without being creepy (he hoped). Delighted when she approached <em>him</em>. Did his best to hop about and look energetic and virile. She soon joined in and they frolicked a bit. (However, her player had to leave.) She seemed sad and he made an effort to comfort her, but she sat. He stood over her to guard her, perhaps she was tired, but swift as could be she was gone in a puff of purple smoke to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go.</p>
		
		<p>Resumed his quest to find company, but for a while, found no luck. Grazed lightly in the Pond, was pestered by a fawn or two, did deer things.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually settled near Aoife, a fertile red deer, due to his bias toward the species (thx Red). Perhaps she would wake up and cavort with him.</p>
		
		<p>Was astonished when, out of the blue, he was approached by alhainen! (No surprise there. I'd just helped her get her set you noodle, but you aren't allowed to know that, so it was spontaneous!) Practically jumped to his hooves and hurried to nuzzle at her, both in fondness and to rub off his scent onto her. Finally, a reasonable deer! Now if only she were sangai... Alas. Spent some time trying to groom her and otherwise reuniting. Only when she settled did he realize he sensed Stria somewhere. Did his best to lead alh to her, utterly unaware that they had had an incident some time back and alh was more than a little against the idea of seeing her again. Much to alh's benefit, Stria was in the company of someone stone did not know, so he settled down with alh nearby to observe and wait.</p>
		
		<p>Zoned out a bit and realized that not only was alh up and about, but Stria had awoken and was nearby, and The Red had appeared. Alhainen seemed to be tense, vaguely in Stria's direction. Got caught up in keeping alh calm, saying hello to his companion, and welcoming his friend. Noticed, in the thick of it, that the Red had lost the ability to see out of his left eye. Felt disbelief at first, then shock. Him? Out of everyone, him? But he was virtually untouchable! How could it be that he, of anyone, could be hurt, like this? Back home, this could be a death sentence. Even here, it could be a death sentence. No, not his friend. Other deer, weaker deer&mdash;not Red. Nudged at his friend, desperate to know what had happened, obvious as it was. Was groomed, consoled. Groomed him back, his concern unabated.</p>
		
		<p>Meanwhile, alhainen and Stria seemed to be getting on fine enough. (Stria, u forgot that u chased alh, lmao.) When Red went off, stone quickly gathered their attention and led the way in following him. He needed to be protected, at least in stone's eyes. He simply had to know his friend would be alright. Thankfully, Red was simply making his way to welcome Djinn, who was in estrus (and smelled wonderful). Greeted Djinn with much delight, watching alh and she exchange greetings in their own ways, before being surprised at how close Stria and Djinn apparently were. He'd smelled them on one another, but he'd never really gotten to see them together. Felt more and more proud of Stria for at least <em>sometimes</em> having good taste. Made an effort to demonstrate to alh that she was safe in this company, though knew she didn't fully believe him&mdash;and good for her.</p>
		
		<p>Then, from the direction of the Crying Idol, stone spotted The Inferno as The Red made his way to greet him. Strangely, did not feel apprehensive, at least not so much as he had before. Saosin made his way to the group, greeting them in his way. When they greeted, stone did not shy away, and Saosin began to groom him. Paused before returning the gesture, having realized that he was fine and his nervousness was clearly, at the moment, for naught. Suddenly, they were basically chill, and it felt nice. Alhainen had basically shut down by this point (and her player had to go to bed, lmao), so he did his best to keep her centered, giving her a path of escape if she needed it.</p>
		
		<p>When things had settled down a bit, Tried to ask Saosin what happened to Red, but The Inferno could not understand his tongue either. Had a personal crisis of identity and a feeling of loss, but at least he and Saosin could perhaps be friends. He was a valuable ally.</p>
		
		<p>Was joined, over time, by Zol, then Es'theriel, then two others (whose names I never caught), and eventually Chiela as well. Spent a very long time grooming Zol, particularly while The Red and The Inferno were gaying together, with Djinn being gayed on by Stria. Was always a bit nervous that Saosin or Red might take offense at his attentions toward her, but they never seemed to even notice. Always in the back of his mind wondered why he was doing this&mdash;there were no Eld's deer here&mdash;but knew he simply could not avoid it, and what was the harm?</p>
		
		<p>Settled in with Stria when he was rudely pulled out of his reveries by a Pelt Enchantment. Sat there, being offended, before sulking and staring at Red in a pathetic way, as he'd helped once before. Red, however, had more important things to intend to than grumpy, whiny old guys with pelt problems, and so stone had to go wash it off. When he came back, the pelt spammer stood before him. He faced him down, returning what he perceived as a challenge to a fight. However, then his perceived opponent sat down near Djinn to receive another spell. Promptly got the fuck out, and was chased around for a time (I'm sure the other player thought they were playing; clearly they were not IC) before being spelled again. (Matched Stria, lmao.) Went to Stria and told him they were going to fight him. She went along with it and he challenged the other in an effort to get him to leave. The other, however, did not take him seriously, and became preoccupied with Red and Saosin's own small duel. Resolved to go to the Pond, again, to wash this one off. Was, however, followed by the being. Stria, in turn, also followed, still making an effort to follow through with fighting him.</p>
		
		<p>Ended up Ruuning around all over, Stria eventually returning to the group, desperate to get this being to leave him alone. Eventually lost him at the Playground and returned to the group, slamming his face into Stria's neck for protection and not coming out for some time. When he did, the being had returned, and was prodding at a smaller deer. Challenged him by facing him dead-on, trying to tell him to stop. Ended up grooming Zol again after he did, standing over her as she left, only to turn and see the spell-casting being poking at Stria. Instantly <em>bristled</em> with rage and stood between them, staring him down the entire time. (Dude chill the their player doesn't get it omfg lmao.) Eventually settled beside Stria, who moved to groom him and get him to settled down, but never took his eyes off of the being. Felt only rage. (Dat testosterone.) After a long while, managed to fall asleep at Stria's side, very tired from the events of previous days compounding onto this one.</p>
		
		<p>And then a dragon attacked. (No, seriously.) Dazenth stirred up quite a bit of trouble. The Red, The Inferno, and the stone balancer all made a show against him which gradually became more and more serious. Found himself grazed more than once while beings ran here and there, just trying to protect Stria. Nothing mattered but Stria, who slept through the entire ordeal (Wind was busy Q Q). Put himself on the line more than once on her account, and only after the dragon abated did he realize he'd been hurt. While nothing serious, he stood over her and did his best to clean his wounds. He refused to sit down.</p>
		
		<p>Though he didn't want to, was forced down to Stria's side by his injuries. Continued tending to them until the bleeding quit, noting that he'd need to wash the blood off if he wanted to appeal to any females. Though he'd have to wait until he had the energy for that&mdash;as he discovered, he'd fucked himself up pretty well. Still, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgByF6KT-M8" target="_blank">the dragon was defeated</a>. After the adrenaline passed, he found he was happy to have relived his glory days, even at the cost.</p>
		
		<p>After he was certain the dragon was gone, he finally allowed himself to rest. And rest he did.</p>
		
		<p>Was brought some willow by The Red at some point, to help with the injuries.</p>

			<h3><time datetime="2015-09-25">September 25, 2015</time></h3>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the Birch, alone but for a nameless deer. Immediately sought out a hill of his own, as he knew no one around and wasn't keen on wooing strangers quite yet. Dozed for a while longer, not yet motivated to do much.</p>
		
		<p>Was just debating going around to look for some company when, like a blanket, the fog lifted all at once. Knew it was Magic to begin with, so was not surprised so much as pleased to be free of the distraction. Actually always enjoyed fog back home, but it just wasn't the same here, at least not now. Went on a romp about the Forest to check on things, deciding that virtually everything remained the same.</p>
		
		<p>Settled in a favoured spot in the Birch (which I always forget about and can NEVER find, but there's a ton of thick grass and it's so nice), waiting for something to happen, unwilling for the moment to instigate anything himself. Longed, in the back of his mind, for a harem, reminiscent of days long past.</p>
		
		<p>Nodded off again. (Old fart.) Awoke rather suddenly certain that he smelled someone familiar, but couldn't quite pinpoint who. Decided to go on a walk, half to see if he could figure it out.</p>
		
		<p>Felt <em>too</em> exposed with the fog gone and hesitated often on his walk. Ambled to Red Hill out of habit, finding no one there. Did, however, smell <em>something</em> of his friend... Ah. One of his children. Was not particularly keen on children as a whole, given his state of mind. Did not go out of his way to find her, and instead went to graze.</p>
		
		<p>Or tried. Was intercepted by Rhona and Gwlithlys. Pokerfaced through it at first, but grew swiftly impatient with their shenanigans and stomped a bit before trotting off in a huff to the Pond to graze in&mdash;he hoped&mdash;peace. He was not interrupted and eventually grew bored of eating. Rather than sitting to chew his cud, he went off wandering some more, perhaps again looking for trouble, or maybe even nothing in particular.</p>
		
		<p>Was standing about, minding his business, when a sort-of feral-looking being ambled up to him, sidelong, as a proper deer should. (User name Fido.) Found himself growing optimistic, despite the large antlers indicating this was likely not a doe. Watched them consume a pine cone from a tree and found himself filling with a sense of dread. Then was covered in peacock feathers from the neck up. Shook in a distinct fit of self-contained rage and started making his way to the Pond. Was spelled again, and simply stared at them over his shoulder as if to ask, <em>'why?'</em> Ventured to the Pond and sunk completely into the water before peeking his face above the surface, refusing to come out further until he was safe, despite how brisk the water was. Sat and watched a spooky come and go from the water-level.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually stood and made his way back to find the young'uns. Found first by a stranger (could not get a pictogram on the map, but wore the Barn Owl Pelt, Barn Owl Mask, and Noh Antlers) right as he stumbled upon Rhona and Gwlithlys. Seemed friendly enough, so accommodated them (going with "her," it looks female to me, lmao). Greeted Rhona kind of. It all spiraled into them all playing and leaping over the stream and stone yelling at clouds about he has a harem (of a stranger and two half-fawns, yeah). He started a scrape on a poor tree and fell into the stream trying to leap it, hurting himself. Getting himself out basically exhausted him but he couldn't risk looking unappealing so he continued to push himself despite being fatigued. Ended up doing himself some harm by the end of the session and ended up being too winded to even try to woo Zol when she showed up. Vaguely recognized Kunst when he showed up but he didn't seem to noticed stone, so let that happen. Ended up grooming with the Barn Owl deer (who I am very fond of) before sitting down while the others danced, hoping not to stand out too much, knowing that he out to be standing to protect any chance he had at this being his harem and look noble and charming. Was joined by the Barn Owl deer and, later, sort of by the kids. Rhona, Gwlithlys, and Kunst ended up piling together, while a stag(?) who had been friendly with Barn Owl deer came by, lured him into a false sense of security with sniffs, and turned him into a raven.</p>
		
		<p>Sat for a good long while contemplating his fate, the choices of the universe, and everything that he had ever done wrong, to his recollection. Decided that this was bullshit and tried his best to get to the Pond. Beak-planted and lay in the grass helplessly for a while before flopping haphazardly in one of the most depressing displays he's ever experienced, now happy that basically everyone had left.</p>
		
		<p>Made it to the Pond perhaps years later and virtually drowned himself in the deep end to rid himself of that atrocious Magic. Did not come out for a very long time, and even then, sat only on the bank, reluctant to risk tasting more Magic.</p>
		
		<p>Fell asleep on the shoreline after a long while of nothing happening and no one disturbing him.</p>

			<h3><time datetime="2015-09-24">September 24, 2015</time></h3>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the Birch.</p>
		
		<p>Went out to find Stria, but she was asleep near Kio and Circe, who he frankly wants nothing to do with. Sat nearby to observe the group, being certain that they were safe and waiting for Stria to wake up all at once.</p>
		
		<p>Nodded off while waiting and found himself joined by none other than Rune! Frolicked about for a time before properly greeting one another. Stood for a while grazing on the dry grasses, too lazy and attached to seek better food for the time being, until settling at the roe's side near Stria's group.</p>
		
		<p>Found himself frustrated that it seemed like whenever he was around, it seemed there were very few deer doing much of anything. (Looking at you, work.) Had grown more open to the idea of rutting, even at this unnatural time for him, simply because it was not like he'd have any other opportunity to, at this rate.</p>
		
		<p>Nodded off at Rune's side. Eventually joined by Stria who rather sleepily stumbled over and plopped among the group. Decided that though he never seemed to get any quality interaction with the closest thing he had to family, sleepy piles were perhaps even preferable to any other interaction. After all, it was some of the only restful sleep he actually got while still being physically present, and it felt somehow different.</p>
		
		<p>Awoke, much later, hungry. Tried to rouse Rune and Stria to come with him. Let loose his first bugle in months&mdash;it felt excellent. Became immediately distracted and overcome with testosterone. Found the highest point on the hill and stood atop it, head-honcho of that hill with four sleeping beings&mdash;two of whom he did not even know or like&mdash;in a Forest mostly asleep and otherwise utterly disinterested. (You go, baby. Don't let them tell you that it didn't matter.)</p>
		
		<p>When literally nothing was changed as a result of his utter domination of the hill, he eventually grew bored and, failing to rouse his grown charges, went off to graze alone.</p>
		
		<p>Got distracted again on the walk to the Pond and went out looking for trouble. Found none. Decided to return to check on his ex-charges, just for a second before getting back to things... Got distracted, again. This time by a lone hind, sitting awake. (Cassiopeia.) Tried his best to impress her (she isn't even the right species, dude), but that's very difficult when there's no one to fight and you don't look like much. Eventually gave up when she didn't even seem to cast a glance his way. Returned to Stria to see if maybe she would fight him and they could <em>both</em> woo the lady, but she had company! Alain was seated beside her, and though stone had caught cursory scents, he'd never met this red deer before. Immediately perceives him to be the same species as The Red. Looked him over and quickly favoured him, despite his confrontational demeanour. Zoned out a bit because I am a professional roleplayer and holy shit Alain is awake and right there what's up lmao. Sniffed a bit, went to Stria to demonstrate that they were close but she was mentally afk. Nuzzled at her and Rune to display his relationship with them before standing vigil at the top of their hill. May have nodded off once or twice...</p>
		
		<p>Eventually, Alain stood as well, and later moved to a spot parallel to him. Took this to mean that they were both guarding the herd. Warmed up a little bit to Circe and Kio simply by virtue of incidentally including them with his "family." Took a futile sense of pleasure seeing that he was allowed, uncontested, the highest point on the hill. (As if that matter, you proud oaf.)</p>
		
		<p>Tried again to invite Cassiopeia, but to no avail. (Pretty sure player is AFK.) Returned to "the herd" to find Alain near Stria. Still a bit irritated that he was not holding such a place, but it was only sensible. Went to go nudge both her and Rune to spread his scent, and thus his meaning. Regardless of anything, they were a herd, no matter who else came and went.</p>
		
		<p>Settled not long after that, finally satisfied that he'd done all he could do in present company. Eventually fell asleep, and went to The Dark Place not long afterward. (A.K.A. it's 3:30 A.M. and I have work today.)</p>

		<p>Awoke, near the Pond. Went to find Stria, as he immediately sensed her.</p>
		
		<p>Found her. Nuzzled and groomed and stood, looking about and obviously contemplating the fog. Eventually moved with her, the both of them rather uncertain, toward some blueberry bushes. Settled there to graze, and eventually full-on sat down and nibbled the bushes about him (wow, lazy), enjoying Stria's company.</p>
		
		<p>After having his fill and chewing his cud for a while, settled at her side (still the big-spoon side, as always, even with her being so much larger and socially more equal to him now) and fell asleep. Went to The Dark Place sometime later.</p>

			<h3><time datetime="2015-09-16">September 16, 2015</time></h3>
		</header>
		<p>Still reluctant to wake up. Strong desire to go home rather than come back.</p>
		
		<p>Made up his mind to wake up eventually, so he did. Opened his eyes and realized The Dark Place had taken his antlers. It was about that time anyway&mdash;spared him the inconvenience.</p>
		
		<p>Realized with a start that he could sense Stria. Immediately flocked to her and discovered her sitting awake with her sleeping friend, yet another strange cat thing (Tsabhi). Was not initially afraid of it, completely distracted by Stria. As he closed the distance, he became aware through smell and sight that she was wounded. Upon closing the distance as much as he cared to, he discovered it had been somewhat severe. She had clearly been attacked by something, wherever she'd been. And yet here she was, cozied up to a predator as it slept. In that moment, stone realized she would never be like him as well as he could imagine. And while she would always keep foolish company, she could clearly handle herself against predators, and must then know that sometimes they were dangerous.</p>
		
		<p>And all at once, he concluded that she had grown up, and seeing as she was so much larger than him, he had nothing left to offer her. Had he not been so stressed about her, and had he been surrounded by his friends for the past few months, he may have still associated others as being more than simply "a herd;" but he had sparsely seen those he knew, and his hatred of this place kept him in The Dark Place more often than not. Everyone here who had been helping him stay sane through his residency seemed able to come and go as they pleased, and thus it was unreasonable of him to consider them as "constants" here, while he himself was unable to leave but for in his sleep.</p>
		
		<p>Emotionally shut down as much as he was capable at this point, though was clearly in a heightened state of stress and pain, he did what came naturally to him: he masked it to make himself as little a target as he could.</p>
		
		<p>When Stria stood to greet him, he was not joyful, as he thought he would be. In fact, he did not really feel anything. After looking her over for some time to see if he was mistaken and he could be of some use, he concluded that he had been correct and went off to care for himself. Stria followed, and he was grateful for the company, as it made him a less prominent target in this place full of predators. First he grazed, drank, and bathed in the Pond; then he ventured to eat some poppies&mdash;distinctly after some of their trademark chemical properties; then he grazed near and in the Blue Bowl for a time; finally, he returned to the Pond and continued nibbling at select greens here and there. All the while she followed. When he finally seemed to settle at nipping bits and pieces from the Pond's shallows, Stria initiated conversation.</p>
		
		<p>Through their conversation, he resolved that while their relationship his most definitely changed it nature and he would try to refrain from being so attached to particular individuals, he could not healthily refrain from holding closer bonds with some. After reconciling with himself the changes made to their relationship, he allowed himself again to feel fully, despite how foolish such a thing technically was. Clearly, now that he was as he was, he needed to.</p>
		
		<p>Fell asleep at Stria's side, safe.</p>

		<p>Awoke, on Red Hill. Lifting his head, noticed a sleeping spooky nearby (Z'ev). Wanted nothing to do with that, so fled to the Blue Bowl, depending on the blueberries to disguise him. Grazed while hiding in a pinnacle of laziness.</p>
		
		<p>Fell asleep while waiting and chewing his cud.</p>
		
		<p>Awoke again to Kauna. Was initially very surprised, as it'd been seasons since he saw her. Stood to sniff politely and started grazing again, even with food still waiting to be chewed further in his stomach.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually over-ate and had to settle back down. Didn't bother leaving the Blue Bowl, but did consider striking up conversation.</p>
		
		<p>Made up his mind and decided to risk talking to her. (Was subconsciously afraid that she, too, would not understand him, and he would again be forced to confront how much has changed.)</p>
		
		<p>Nodded off for a while after conversing. First was joined by Rhona&mdash;Kauna and Red's daughter. Reacted very little to the fawn, leaving interaction to her mother. Was eventually joined by The Red. Greeted him then went back to being asleep and boring.</p>
		
		<p>Awoke alone with Rhona. Scented The Red not far off but elected to stay where he was. Something felt "off" about him lately, and it seemed best to give him space. Also felt Talla somewhere farther off, though was certain that she did not remember him.</p>
		
		<p>Did his best to occupy the young red deer, his mind carrying him back to that day when he'd awoken to a week-old roe curled at his side, the day he'd first met Rune. Proved himself to be rather poor company when he dozed off, again. Thankfully, she occupied herself by simply dozing at her side. They remained undisturbed for a while.</p>
		
		<p>Joined eventually by Sevigne. Delighted to meet yet <em>another</em> of Red's fawns. Watched over them (terribly) for some time. Eventually, Sevigne left. Later, Rhona cast a Pelt Enchantment on stone and he had to go wash it off in the Pond. Was directed to meeting Hera, a herd-mate of Kauna's. Also was swarmed by a couple of other fawns. Had a tiny shaking party with Rhona. Ate some water-plants and drank some water. Eventually utterly lost Rhona and decided to go sit by Red, despite the illness.</p>
		
		<p>On his way over, went to check on Talla from a distance. She didn't seem well, but he recognized that he couldn't help. Left her.</p>
		
		<p>Found The Red asleep and took up an adjacent blueberry bush to chew his cud while the fellow hart slept. Eventually, after Red had awoken, gave in and rested himself. Ventured to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, at the Pond's edge. Didn't even really get up&mdash;wasn't particularly hungry or thirsty. Nibbled at small growths near his feet and turned once to drink, but otherwise simply sat, constructing a cairn and dozing on and off.</p>
		
		<p>Woke after a long nap to Rune. Sleepily moved to nuzzle the buck and fell back asleep on him. (Wow, how nice, stone. Haven't seen your adopted kid for months and you just fall asleep.) Eventually woke up and stood to more properly greet him, but alas, then Rune was asleep. Sat at his side, but Rune eventually went off to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go. A bit disappointed that he hadn't been awake to properly interact with the buck, settled back down, ignoring his cairn. Eventually, fell asleep and went to The Dark Place himself.</p>

		<p>Awoke, at the Pond's edge. Allowed some beings to use his Spell-Giving-Daze to cast some Pelt Enchantments on one another, so long as they left him out of it. Got up when they were finished and grazed the pond plants, paying little heed to the denizens around him, despite some being fairly spooky-looking.</p>
		
		<p>Considering that nothing had happened across all of grazing and bathing, eventually settled at the Pond's edge to keep cool, not finding reason to leave the spooky beings. He seemed safe.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually fell asleep and returned to The Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Finding no immediate trace of any friend, went all about the Forest for no particular reason.</p>
		
		<p>As he wandered, slowly came to realize that he had not seen Stria in the past few uneventful days, which was odd. Though he had taken it for granted, he realized that he could not easily recall a time in which he'd come to and she was not present, if not physically then at least some trace of her. He could tell, here and there, where she'd been some time ago. There was nothing recent, however, and that was slightly concerning. He pushed it to the back of his mind. If she was not there, she was not there. Maybe she went some place like where he did. He would simply keep an eye out for her and expect her to turn up. It had never been a problem before. In fact, as he thought about it, Rune and Khuna and H. were prone to being away for seasons at a time, and they were fine. Surely she would be too. Surely.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually grew bored of wandering and returned to the Pond to graze. Later settled and fell asleep.</p>

		<p>Not quite of his own volition, stone woke up today.</p>
		
		<p>Didn't even have to go looking for anyone, as The Red and The Inferno were literally a patch away. In fact, it was Red who really woke him up.</p>
		
		<p>Never was groggy before, when on Earth. Now however, can be a bit <em>too</em> human for his own good. Woke up and stumbled to his feet, laid his head on Red to groom but half nodded back off. Was then led back to sit, but kept his distance from The Inferno, as usual. Wasn't worried, just wasn't comfortable with him.</p>
		
		<p>Lay down on his side, face in the dirt, digging his antlers into the dry soil while idly grazing on the fibrous grass of the Birch, out of instinct rather than hunger.</p>
		
		<p>Came to realize that a lot of time must have passed because Red's antlers were grown and he was soon to shed his velvet. Thankfully, he still had his own to rely upon and well, and felt that he would for a while yet. After all, he hadn't gotten around to using them much. Sat and felt bad about leaving Stria and Rune to themselves for so long, even though they were surely used to it by now. He'd have to find them and check on how they were, but he couldn't feel them anywhere right then.</p>
		
		<p>Due to having grazed and rested amply in The Dark Place, he was actually in perfect health and fullness, which felt bizarre, being asleep for so long.</p>
		
		<p>Lay for a long time, still dozing, only really sometimes paying any mind to the world about him. Eventually shifted closer to Red; The Inferno seemed rather tempered now, probably due to whatever had caused him to be in that comatose state back whenever that had been.</p>
		
		<p>Was kind of relieved to not be rutting anymore. Last time he had anything to do with a rut, he decided to court a predator. Though that hadn't turned out so bad, it wasn't an experience he was eager to repeat.</p>
		
		<p>Was awoken from nodding off by The Red shifting to greet someone. Raised his head and noticed a tiny fawn (Kunst). My God, how new. Startlingly, there was no mother to be seen. "What do these kids eat." Watched The Red interact with him&mdash;in combination with his scent, surmised the relation. Stood to greet the little one, not really feeling involved but thinking it polite and sensible.</p>
		
		<p>Went off alone to graze after The Red settled back down and The Inferno had gotten up to greet the fawn, comfortable enough with himself to graze only relatively within proximity of them. Was deciding what to eat when he heard The Inferno call. Turning, he saw the stag hurrying after him, only to rapidly circle him a few times before sniffing him and circling more. Recognized the gesture from his own use of it as a way of asking to follow or return, but found the whole scenario rather bizarre. Expressed his confusion by the unnatural but effective tilt of his head, but received no answer as The Inferno returned to Red. They proceeded to have a tiff, returning to stone only to end up at first simply sparring before a more H.felt debate. Stone merely watched in bewilderment before simply deciding to continue on his way. Noticed the Blue Bowl and decided on that. Stood and grazed on berries and chutes for a long while, eventually settling where he stood rather that immediately returning to the oddness that had since&mdash;given the quiet that had again settled over the Birch&mdash;been resolved.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually got lonely and returned to the group, keeping away from the pair as they groomed back into agreement&mdash;Red clearly having proven his point&mdash;and noting that the tiny fawn had not left.</p>
		
		<p>Lingered about, sleeping on and off, until well after The Inferno and The Red had left. Eventually, went off himself.</p>

		<p>(Guess who started his rut. -Watches stone cavort about, making all sorts of noise and trouble. And Stria following, taking his example all the way.- Ah, it begins.)</p>
	
		<p>Tl;dr awoke PUMPED. FOUND STRIA. CHILLED. LEFT. TOOK A BATH. WAS JOINED BY STRIA. RAN AROUND. MADE SOME SOUNDS. KINDA CHALLENGED SOME DUDES. DIDN'T FIGHT. THAT'S COOL. HUNG OUT WITH STRIA A LOT. EVENTUALLY FELL ASLEEP. EXTREME.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Right next to Stria, Muiel, Rohit, and Abhiri. Went to greet his charge, though was first noticed by Muiel. Reciprocated sniffs. Went to graze then sat down to ruminate until he was noticed by Stria. Greeted and eventually played a little. Dealt with some randoms. Sat and slept on and off. Eventually moved to puddle when he noticed Stria had gone off to sit with Muiel. Slept more.</p>

		<p>Awoke and noticed Red was nearby. Went to him. Saw he was in fucking awful shape. Offered a nuzzle then set about collecting food for him so maybe he wouldn't keel over. (Also plopped a single mouthful of food onto Saosin in a peace offering to the dead-not-dead giant being, hoping he wouldn't die because Red wouldn't cope well. Kind of assumed he wouldn't because he'd lived this long without moving and that wasn't normal, so there must be something keeping him going.) Roped Stria into it, successfully being the first to ever level and ask her for help. Proceeded to gather food and drop it off at Red with Stria.</p>

		<p>Eventually noticed H.. Holy shit. Went to say hi and asked her to, "Get plants." Proceeded to watch her topple a sapling and drag it all the way to Red. Okay. (Well, it isn't wrong.)</p>

		<p>Watched Stria throw a fit. Did not know why. Went to stop her. Failed. Made sounds after her then gave up and brought one more mouthful of food to Red before settling, having made about eight too many trips around the Forest. Was joined by H. and eventually Stria after they made up. (Stria you're an independent animal, you can't just act aloof with your mother then get mad when she treats you like an adult and goes about her business.)</p>

		<p>Was groomed by Red. Groomed Red. Existed in a herd of his favourite beings (minus Rune). Had a hella day. Sure hopes Red doesn't die.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually told everyone he loved them and fell asleep.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Wandered around. Itched his velvet off a bit more. Ate some, drank some. Met a stranger who insisted on dancing (username TheFlyingRomana). Continued grazing through it. Carefully avoided said stranger the moment it went to a spell tree, being very familiar with what that tree did. In the process of avoiding the stranger, bumped into Stria. Attempted to convey to her that he was, in fact, fleeing while she was generally "OMG" at him. Delighted to see the stranger cough off the spell after it caught up. Watched it take its leave before finally properly greeting the hind and grooming her to re-establish bonds.</p>
	
		<p>As usual, was rather astounded with her growth. Sort of wondered if she'd just never stop. Briefly imagined that. Stopped.</p>
	
		<p>Was delighted to see that her version of grooming him today was going to be eating his shedding velvet. Please. Take all of it. You are the best.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually tried to get up. Was not allowed. Supposed she really <em>was</em> going to take all of it. Hella.</p>
	
		<p>Stria settled after a while and fell asleep at his side. He let himself do the same. Eventually, he left for the Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Had hardly lifted his head when he realized he'd appeared practically atop The Red and The Inferno. Got to his hooves and set about grooming and generally comforting Red. Grazed on the dry grasses so as not to leave Red. Eventually settled down with him, ruminating and dozing.</p>
	
		<p>Awoke to a stranger (Kostya) keeping Red company. Took his leave while the Red had a friend to get some proper nutrition and water. Made his way to the Pond only to see Thais sitting in the Pond itself. Was rather irritated to find the being who smelled of poison sitting in the primary drinking water supply. Snorted to himself and walked back to the Crying Idol to drink from the untainted source. Drank, and ignored the urge to bathe due to the temperature. Grazed on some blueberries and various greens. Noting Red's friend seemed to have left, gathered as much good food he could carry in his mouth and returned to where he lay with Saosin. Set the food down before Red, then sat down and ruminated.</p>
	
		<p>Was too lazy to itch himself to shed his velvet. Hoping someone else comes around to clean it off for him so he doesn't have to bother.</p>
	
		<p>Napped on and off throughout the day, his lax vigil providing Red enough comfort to rest. Eventually drifted off to the Dark Place when he felt he was no longer needed.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Blue Bowl. To his initial surprised distress, noticed Talla and someone (Nidhem) resting nearby, though Talla looked quite vigilant and the other did not look well. Took a second to observe them before quietly slipping away so as not to frighten the kind roe.</p>
	
		<p>To his benefit, the moment he awoke, Red's scent drifted to him on the wind. He followed. He found the hart guarding The Inferno. It did not take much to understand that something was wrong here too. The greeting was quiet, but close. Red's tension was completely obvious, and it was only natural to be comforting and safe. Stood grooming and leaning for some time.</p>
	
		<p>Greeted Djinn when she came around. (APPARENTLY STONE KNEW SHE'D REMEMBER HIM BECAUSE I WENT TO SNIFF HER AND STONE DECIDED, NO, A NUZZLE IS IN ORDER HERE? OKAY.) Delighted to discover he was remembered or at least welcomed. Stood by Red while he rested, then sat to the side while he socialized with Djinn. Eventually, a stranger came by and stone took that as his cue to leave. Though he was not tired, the Dark Place called to him.</p>

			<h3><time datetime="2015-01-16">January 16, 2015</h3>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke, near the Crying Idol. Took one glance around, hardly lifting his head, before shoving his face back into the warmth of his side, outright refusing to get up.</p>
	
		<p>Abruptly remembered that he is the itchiest thing in the Forest at the moment. Rather than be an adult, merely shoved his head deeper into his side, almost burying himself in his own flesh and fur. Continued about this way for some time.</p>
	
		<p>Noticed he was tolerating the cold better than he was before, and that though his antlers had grown to their full size while he was out of the Forest, he had not lost weight. His fur, in fact, seemed to have thickened slightly as insulation&mdash;or perhaps he was simply being less timid, and his mood was affecting how he felt. Either way, things were going remarkably well, despite the cold weather.</p>
	
		<p>Finally got up out of boredom. Stood, feeling around for a while, before galloping over to the Pond for a drink. Wanted to wallow in the water, but knew better than to take a swim with the air cool like it was. Continued searching for anyone he knew, but was disappointed to recognize nothing (though I totally noticed Peregryn and Circe, so it's not like there wasn't a chance of something interesting happening, stone is just a lame old dude).</p>
	
		<p>Got Devout pelted by a fawn, much to his disgust. Utilized the sneezing (which he may consider to be Magic in and of itself) method to getting it off, not in the mood to get himself cold just to show the fawn what was "right" for him. Stood facing the fawn directly, though he knew the body language would be lost on it. Got another spell&mdash;a mask&mdash;this time just 8l-ing through it until the fawn left, then shaking it off. Went off to go rub his itchy velvet until it stopped bothering him again, not bothering to wash the blood this time.</p>
	
		<p>Idly wandered around. Took his time looking at sleeping beings carefully, taking advantage of their vulnerable state to observe them in more detail than he otherwise had the opportunity to do.</p>
	
		<p>Got lost in the Birch while trying to find the Blue Bowl, as usual. Got annoyed at being lost in the Birch. Then stumbled onto it. (Genius.) Ate blueberries&mdash;ignoring the fact they grew year-round entirely now&mdash;and whatever else appealed to him, then sat down to ruminate. Swiftly grew entirely bored of routine and set about building some cairns.</p>
	
		<p>Then settled down to rest. Went away to the Dark Place.</p>

			<h3><time datetime="2015-01-15">January 15, 2015</h3>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. ITCHIER BUT NOT ITCHY (velter ready to shed is hard to describe) THAN THE END OF DAYS. IT IS ALSO COLD. "Why did I come back again?" Reluctantly got to his feet. Stone fell in De Drinkplaats, startling him. He began to run, then thought: "Oh no, not this again." Turned around, told that statue thing off, then trotted off at his own pace. (Wow, not gonna be such a ninny anymore? This because you have your antlers back, or did all that time away make you forget how much you hate this place?)</p>
	
		<p>Trotted and galloped around, building up some heat in his muscles to insulate against the cool air and stretch his joints. Called out just to see who'd respond. (Wow. I'm impressed.) Found himself on Red Hill by complete accident. Figured it was as good a place as any to begin the arduous process ahead. With a sigh of resignation, found a tree that looked like it wouldn't mind some abuse and set to work rubbing off his velvet.</p>
	
		<p>Got tired and bored after the itching stopped. Shook repeatedly to rid himself of the slight amounts of blood even allowing the skin to dry out could not eliminate and went to go rinse himself off in the warm water of the Crying Idol. While he was there, shoved some water plants into his gullet and settled in the open to ruminate. Fell asleep not long afterward because there was so little going on. Went back to The Dark Place, for the moment.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Again, scented The Red and took his side, Saosin nowhere to be sensed. Excellent</p>
	
		<p>Lay with him for some time, absorbing what he could of Red's warmth and dozing. Not cold per se, but not comfortable.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually, noticed Red had awoken and was standing. Lifted his head to glance around, not detecting any threats. Cold and groggy, plopped back down, letting Red stare at whatever all he wanted. (What a compliment, stone! You weren't even vaguely nervous!)</p>
	
		<p>Got up later. Nuzzled and stuff. Red instigated a bout of play-chase, and so they chased each-other in circles, stone limping while his muscles warmed up. Soon stone was Ruuning, though still limping oddly. The game evolved into touch-and-run (tag), which Red proved to be quite adept at, though stone's stiff muscles weren't exactly beneficial. Red abruptly hid in some grasses, and following his nose, stone was able to finally touch him. (He really never would have won otherwise.) Stone took off, and it devolved into Red staring and stone staring, Red slowly advancing and stone waiting until the last minute to bolt. Soon, Red turned away and began trotting elsewhere. Stone grew childishly upset&mdash;"But it's your turn to chase me!"&mdash;and followed Red, throwing a half-joking taunt-tantrum.</p>
	
		<p>Figured out Red was thirsty and hungry and left the game behind, happy just to be with his friend. Stood watch while Red drank from the Crying Idol, then drank and bathed while he was watched over. (I headcanon that the Crying Idol fountain must be warm, if not hot, because the Pond never freezes over. Much of the heat is lost while travelling through the stream, so the Pond itself is likely fairly cool. The water coming from the Idol is about average shower temperature.) Trotted to some grasses where they both grazed. Regretted bathing because the air was, in fact, still cold, regardless of the water temperature. Returned to the Crying Idol where The Red bathed. Now they could be cold together. &58;D Just kidding, Red has a thick undercoat. (Sorry stone.) Grazed once more, being joined by a fawn who seemed rather confused. Kind of... Looked after it, I guess. Mostly just let it hang out with them while they ate and then ruminated.</p>
	
		<p>Followed The Red back to the Birch, cutting through the Blue Bowl to Red Hill. Settled. Promptly fell asleep and left for the Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Blue Bowl. Scented The Red and took his side. Was sat closer to. Hung out. Fell asleep.</p>
	
		<p>Slept through something with Red and Saosin. Awoke to Red far away with The Inferno. Meandered closer to observe, noticing they were with quite a few others, Reed among them. Hid rather well (O: shocking) among some grasses, becoming completely enamoured with the area and its dense cover. Observed the group. Realizing he was fairly well-hidden, managed to doze off again. Awoke with The Red sitting before him. Licked his nose and got his lip licked in return. Had a sort of conversation, but non-verbally. Becoming more at peace with The Red's situation though still would like to see him equal to Saosin again. Knows it will always be violence between them&mdash;they're fated for it.</p>
	
		<p>When The Red went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go, stone followed to the Dark Place. Dreamt of warm grasses of pale gold, sunbeams, and a friend.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Immediately felt Stria and ran to her. Conveniently, she was at the Pond, having a drink. Went to join in, noticing she seemed more than a little worse for wear. Nuzzled her, drinking while listening to a bit of babble. The scent of the Tigress on her (though Joro's did not go unnoticed), stone deduced something had happened. Though he had warned her, did his best to bring her what comfort was in his power. Felt badly for the Tigress. He didn't hate her, he just couldn't trust her kind. She'd nurtured and protected Stria. She wasn't bad&mdash;by all indications, she was a friend. He just couldn't trust her. But she didn't deserve to suffer. Was happy not to be more involved.</p>
	
		<p>Was joined by Rune, to his extreme delight. Led his charges out of the Pond because it was way too cold for him. They all settled on its shore and kept stone warm, for once. They were joined by a fawn and an adult, who went right ahead and joined the pile. Stone thought it odd but they seemed alright, so he allowed it. The adult used Magic on the fawn, which put stone off, but considering everything, it was okay. With Stria so large and Rune to boot, stone felt pretty secure.</p>
	
		<p>Stria slipped off to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go. It was odd to see that, as stone realized&mdash;with a pang of guilt&mdash;he was almost always the one to leave <em>her</em>. (Dat player time zone.) Rune immediately moved to cover stone as best as he could with the loss of one of his deer heaters. Dozed on and off.</p>
	
		<p>Awoke to an odd sound. Magic? got to his hooves before he even realized what was happening, looking straight into the eyes of the two who were using him for Pelt Enchantment Spells. Oh, gross. Trotted away, realizing he was being followed by one of them. Continued trotting, then broke out into a gallop, then a plain sprint, the pursuer hot on his tail. Got more and more alarmed, trying to dodge and weave, but he would not give. Tore through the Blue Bowl, then had an idea (A.K.A. being chased frightened the player and I wanted to be done). Wove back to the Blue Bowl, dodging through trees at the last second into a thicket in an attempt to hide. (A.K.A. I disconnected.) His pursuer evaded, made his way to Red Hill. Stood watch for his pursuer's return. (Then I went OOC to try to figure out who it was for plot, but to no avail. If you chased stone today, hi! &#58;D) To his delight, and relief, scented The Red. Sprinted to him.</p>
	
		<p>Pleasantries momentarily abandoned, basically just mashed his face into Red. But it's okay because the mashings were returned. Clearly, the stress signals communicated all they needed to. Was groomed and calmed and generally pleasantly dominated in a reassuring manner. Shortly after, was joined by a charming if not aloof red deer doe (Matrona) and welcomed her company. Felt Saosin somewhere. Prickled to himself, worried Saosin was drawing nearer. Stood guard to alert The Red if he drew any nearer, but decided he was not. Felt Rune waking up on his periphery, and sprinted to fetch him to join the herd. Rune was, in fact, also sprinting toward him, and it became a bout of Ruuning and leaping and play, then they trotted playfully back to Matrona and Red- and Saosin. (Lol there goes the mood.) Prickled more, adopting a submissive posture as soon as he realized who it was, not taking chances. Red came to greet the pair, and stone left him one somewhat-parting relatively fierce nuzzle. An apology, of sorts. He was helpless, and it caused such a flurry of emotions, few of which he could put a word to. He was so upset. Allowed The Red to go back to the confrontation, sadness in his eyes, fear in his posture.</p>
	
		<p>Rune, being Rune, had no idea what was happening. While The Red and The Inferno clashed, Rune made an effort to imitate them, much to stone's complete dismay. Matrona played with the buck while stone watched, flabbergasted. Ultimately, stone stood amongst four active deer, watching everything unfold in horror. Now not only was he worried for his friend, but his charge, who clearly could get himself hurt in his naiveté. Witnessed The Red spell Saosin, who seemed rather stunned and ran off to the Crying Idol. The Red sat back down. Was, well, awe-stricken, all second-thoughts about allowing The Red to dominate him this season abandoned. Circled the area, keeping his posture submissive lest The Inferno return&mdash;and return he did. Saosin circled back around them all and startled stone halfway across the hill. Reoriented his posture and watched the fight continue. Eventually, as before, The Red was forced into submission. Witnessed the dominance displays wordlessly but full of feelings and thoughts, none good. Perhaps the worst thing he's ever seen another put through, put themselves through. Maybe it was just because he respected the hart so much, but it was nearly intolerable. But he could do nothing. Was deeply unsettled.</p>
	
		<p>Then [alhainen] showed up. Delighted to see her, but confused as well. With so much testosterone in the air, was shocked she even came near. The small herd of feral beings must have been that enticing. Saosin and The Red had settled to some degree, the stag standing over the hart. Kept a wary eye on The Inferno, especially when he saw alh leading out a tiny fawn. Her fawn. Now? Oh, he was delighted, flattered to see she trusted him and his company with this moment. But <em>now</em>? Sniffed at the fawn. Oh, she was cute. Watched Rune interact with her. Forced himself not to just lean down and nuzzle at her. She was really, really cute. She definitely lifted his spirits.</p>
	
		<p>Stood watch, though submissively, to be certain he could at least warn them off if something went poorly. Alh grazed with the fawn nestled in a thicket nearby, Rune played, Matrona went back toward the stag and hart to sit near a tree. Soon, Alh led her fawn back to the Blue Bowl, having noticed she was getting sleepy. Stone wished her a fond farewell. Hopefully he could spend some more time with her soon, under better circumstances.</p>
	
		<p>Saosin left, apparently having had his fill of dominating The Red for the time being, or perhaps drawn away to visit another, stone didn't care. He went to his friend. The apology was there in his expression, his body language. It was brief. He didn't want to upset the others. They all sat or grazed for a while. Unsurprisingly, Saosin eventually came back. This spooked alh, who fled. Rune did his best to tell Saosin off, not wanting the fallow to be frightened. Stone, alarmed, assumed Rune was trying to play. As soon as he could, he pulled Rune aside and harshly reprimanded him, nuzzling to be sure the buck knew it was out of concern, not anger, that he acted out. Rune went to join alh. Stone watched The Inferno, The Red. Then he joined the others.</p>
	
		<p>They stood together for some time. Stone didn't notice as a large group formed nearby, including Reed. Only when The Red was over with them did he come to, alarmed by the strangers. Alh, who'd had enough, made her way to Red Hill. Stone followed, and Rune kept pace. Once they reached her, he nuzzled them both to reassure them, then ventured into the Blue Bowl to warm himself up and hide. They joined him, Rune acting as a blanket. Swiftly warmed up, and left the Blue Bowl to peek in on Red and Saosin. Rune and alh followed, but as soon as alh realized why he'd left, she went back into hiding. Rune went to sit on his own. (His player had to go for a while.) Stone stood on the hill, watching them, head to the air to catch scent signals. They seemed to have settled. Still, he ignored the cold. He needed to know what was happening to his friend.</p>
	
		<p>He didn't noticed Reed until he was <em>right there</em> (HOLY SHIT MATT YOU'RE KILLIN' ME HERE MY H.) and reacted accordingly: by nearly bolting in terror. Sniffed at Reed with incredible reluctance, only not Ruuning due to The Red's positive interaction with him, the fact he was kind of in the middle of something, and because if he ran to the Blue Bowl he'd be leading Reed right to alh and her fawn. Three sniffs later, each more awkward than the last, stone had gone from a display of caution, to fear, to complete submission. Reed, likely unwittingly, faced stone directly, which he misperceived as a challenge. Stone repeatedly tried to back out of this, but Reed simply turned to face him once more each time. Feeling very uncomfortable, stone tried to just back away entirely, and Reed soon left himself. With one last glance to Red and Saosin, stone went to hide in the Blue Bowl. Feeling better, he went to stand over Rune, who still slept. Reed, however, was soon watching him from the opposing side. They locked eyes for a long time, too long. Red and Saosin both left to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go, and Reed walked away. Reassured, stone settled by Rune to leech some of his warmth. Alh stayed close, looking tired. She took a final refuge in the Blue Bowl as Rune woke back up. Stone settled with Rune, calmed significantly.</p>
	
		<p>Stone glanced around, and almost died when he saw Reed sitting, staring at them, a few trees away. (MATT. MATT <em>PLEASE</em>. I ONLY HAVE ONE HEART. MATT. SERIOUSLY HE WAS KEEPING AT EYE ON REED'S PICTOGRAM HOW DID THAT HAPPEN.) Not wasting a second, both he and Rune elected to get the fuck out. They ran to near the Playground, where Rune felt satisfied enough to sit. Stone did not. Soon, Rune was standing as well. Time passed. Nothing happened. Stone eventually settled, dozing.</p>
	
		<p>When he awoke, there was no one. Rune must have gone again, but his Pictogram was also nowhere to be found. Goodbye for now, then. Stone made his way to the Playground and hid beneath the slanted stone, warming himself as best as he could. Soon though, some spooky-looking beings were gathered nearby, and stone didn't want to stay around that. He trotted to the Blue Bowl, where he settled in the thickest bunch of bramble he could find, and found himself warm enough to doze. He stayed this way for some time, checking only to see that he remained alone, that Reed had not somehow found his way in close again. It was a fitful and somewhat frightened sort of sleep. Eventually, his body decided it might be best for him to leave, and so he went to the Dark Place. He had bad dreams of towering beasts of flame that took his friends away and strange beings who were gone then right there and stared and stared and stared.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. (Technically saw Reed upon first waking, but I minimized and it would be too hard to write for. Oops.) Scented Red, but was having a hard time finding where he was. (A.K.A. I can't read Pictograms to save my life.) Felt Saosin. Had an idea. Went to The Inferno, carefully keeping a great deal of distance. Indeed, the moment he laid eyes on the War Stag, The Red was easy to find. (This was admittedly weird. I went with stone's idea and the second I saw Saosin, there was Red's picto. Wtf. Okay stone.) Happily joined The Red and his herd, consisting of Djinn, María, and Trees. Exchanged snuffles with Trees (and totally didn't have an awkward stare-down while I fumbled to make sniff work) and ultimately approved. Grazed for a while before joining them in sitting to ruminate.</p>
	
		<p>(Kauna joined at some point, either before or after what followed. Idk when. But she ended up being there and stone was totally delighted.) Stood with Red for a while, grooming and such. Noticed Red stiffen. Turned to see Saosin. Gave one last groom-motion in something as close to apology as he could muster. Got out of that.</p>
	
		<p>The girls stood to greet The Inferno. Stone maintained a submissive posture and avoided looking even near him, only turning to face Saosin to return a sniff, then resuming the display of submission as quickly as possible. Observed Red begrudgingly sit down, feeling for him the entire time. Luckily, Saosin kept his visit brief, apparently satisfied by the display enough without humiliating Red further in front of company. Hurried to Red as soon as things were clear, resting his head on the hart's back but refraining from grooming, allowing him to initiate that&mdash;one of the few things he could do for his friend, allow him one small act of dominance toward another, consensually.</p>
	
		<p>Settled with the hart, the does having long ago sat down around them, smooshed together. Remained that way, dozing on and off, until stone scented someone new. Stood to face them, finding the new face threatening (Reed). Stood, keeping an eye on him, in an unsure posture. Djinn joined him in staring, on and off.</p>
	
		<p>Reed came closer, then went away again, but always stayed in view. (Well, to me. Stone saw blobs. Smelled him though.) Red remained asleep, so stone did his best to guard the group.</p>
	
		<p>When Reed got too close, María stood, went to him, and they interacted. Stone observed, but couldn't draw any conclusions from it. Reed withdrew.</p>
	
		<p>When The Red stood up, he immediately went to Reed, and stone watched with interest. However, María hurried over, taunted, and chased Reed off. Dang. You go, doe. Stone was quite impressed with her bravery, especially considering the pregnancy.</p>
	
		<p>When Reed returned, Red got to him before anyone else could, and they greeted in a friendly manner. Stone was a little perplexed but accepted it. Maybe Reed was fine. Maybe Red just had weird friends, if Saosin was any indication. Either way, stone returned to the herd, standing but no longer so defensive.</p>
	
		<p>Some strangers came by which left stone a bit spooked. Djinn joined his side, not spooked whatsoever but looking for friendly company. He groomed her. They're friends now, simple as that.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually, Red returned. Djinn sat down. Stone, having stood for so long, no longer saw a reason to sit, so just stood for a long while. With everyone but himself and Djinn asleep, it seemed reasonable to stand watch, even when all seemed safe. Felt Reed and Saosin together some distance away. Was curious about the nature of their interaction, but did not attempt to learn more. Eventually, settled with the group. Watched Kauna leave to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go, then María, then Djinn, leaving he and Red alone. Immediately snugged close to the hart, no longer feeling the need to cover how cold he was with the less familiar does gone. Did some head-resting and idle grooming and other such things. Tried to not be cold.</p>
	
		<p>To his delight, was joined by Yoko, at some distance. Tried to welcome her nearer (totally not only because it'd be warmer), but ultimately let her keep her distance, noticing she was kind of withdrawn. Tried to politely sit between the two deer, but it was too cold. Practically crawled inside of Red. (Warm weather deer and cool weather mix awfully.) Stayed this way for some time, dozing in Red's warmth. (Darn you, cool weather deer!) Awoke when Red stood, standing too without thinking. Was Saosin back? Noticed Red looking behind him. Turned his head...</p>
	
		<p>And was shocked. Jumped and turned around. A unicorn??? What was a unicorn??? Magical being but not Forest Magic good magic great magic healing being mythological creature benign nature blessed animal bringer of light&mdash;was overwhelmed by Magical input of knowledge. Wow. Oh she was beautiful. Oh, wow. Was absolutely awe-stricken. Observed her (Isolde), completely blown away. Tried to sniff her, then second-guessed himself. Was it rude to smell unicorns??? Desperately didn't want to be rude. Stepped to and fro trying to decide what to do. This was decided for him when she starting Ruuning about in play or whatever it was unicorns did anything in. Yoko had joined immediately, and he felt the need to as well. Slowly at first, then quickly, the constant pain in his joints evaporating with the healing nature of a unicorn's company. Felt joy. Awe. Wonder. Adoration.</p>
	
		<p>As quickly as she'd come, she left, galloped into the distance. Watched her, desperately wanted to follow, tried to but knew he could not, somehow. She was so fast. And Red, with Saosin around, he couldn't leave. Stood watching where she'd gone for a very long time, feeling more torn than he ever had. What a wonderful being. He was so taken.</p>
	
		<p>Rejoined Red, casting him several glances. 'Did you see that???' 'What was that???' 'She was beautiful!!!' 'How wonderful...' 'Do you think she'll come back...?' They seemed to say. Red just sat, inwardly smiling to himself. Stone refused to sit, giddy, hoping she'd return.</p>
	
		<p>Red faded to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go. Stone made his best effort to nuzzle at the smoke he left. Then he took Yoko's side at a polite distance. The closer. And closer still. Eventually, they were snugged together, which was nice because she was warm. The encounter having left him healed and somehow warmer even without the deer at his side, stone found himself dozing. Eventually, he too faded away to the Dark Place. In his dreams, a galloping unicorn, perhaps the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Delighted to see it is twilight, kind of. Unusually warm crepuscular period (~60 F/15.5 C). Took to the Pond immediately, still too cool to bathe but thirsty. Drank his fill and hurried away because there was a spooky sitting on the water in the middle of the Pond.</p>
	
		<p>Sat by the Crying Idol for a little bit, getting a decent look at it. It seemed okay. He couldn't help but feel somehow it was different than the Magic. Maybe even kind of okay.</p>
	
		<p>Meandered over to the Playground when he realized it was clear. Checked to see if the rocks were warm from earlier sun, discovered they were not as thus it had been twilight for some time or had been night. Who knew with this place. Curled up under the slanted stone, seeking more warmth from the shelter and dense vegetation. Only moments later, scented The Red, and got back to his hooves.</p>
	
		<p>Hopped up on a rock to see better. Watched The Inferno dust-bathe, two randoms run by, and so on. Tried to climb the Playground to get a better understanding of what was happening, as The Red had joined the Inferno. Fell three times. By the time he got to the top, two deer were there and he was too spooked to approach them. Reluctantly descended the Playground to find a better point of observation. Tried hiding in the Blue Bowl, but realized he couldn't smell much there with the berries, and couldn't see a thing. Shifted around a little, noticing someone (Sloane) a bit away. Watched her, kind of wanting to meet her, when she wandered over to him. They sniffed, she seemed very enthusiastic&mdash;in a manner which made him nervous&mdash;and then she was away. O&hellip;kay. Kind of thought, "Who is she?" (Fucking lol holy shit stone pls.) Wasn't against the idea of meeting her again, despite how... Odd, she seemed.</p>
	
		<p>Returned to the Birch and hid totally sneakily in a tiny bunch of grass to lurk the interaction, keeping a careful eye on a spooky (Romulus) nearby.</p>
	
		<p>Observed a fight??? Moved during the early portion of it to observe a bit better barely avoiding the path it took. Continued to watch, standing, until a falling stone in De Drinkplaats spooked him. (Stone you idiot what did you learn last time.) Ran like a fawn. Sheepishly sneaked back, keeping an eye on Ramsus... Who also kept an eye on him. Ran a little, glancing back. Observed the other turn to face him. Ran a lot. Tried to avoid The Red and The Inferno, accidentally bumping into Thais and another around a tree. Sheepishly turned <em>back</em>, trying to find another thicket a bit further from De Drinkplaats. To his delight though, before he could, was joined by The Red and groomed. All is okay with the world. Returned the grooming after he'd calmed down a little.</p>
	
		<p>Then another spooky (Virus) appeared! Recognized Virus from a couple of days ago on a trip to the Pond. Would have been happy to just leave, but The Red (is 10x less of a puss, gj stone u coward) was having none of that, and turned to face Virus in a threat display. Stone, really, really not wanting a part of it, was hesitant, and maintained a submission display. With Red advancing, stone felt poorly just leaving him alone in the affront, and reluctantly turned to challenge as well, though kept taking steps backward after he approached and more than once shifted fearfully on his hooves.</p>
	
		<p>In a moment of intellect, connected some dots: Red's missing tines, Red and Inferno's strained socialization, Inferno's size, Red's demeanour... Oh. <em>Oh</em>. Regained his nerve. Even against something so large, with The Red leading the display, felt calm enough to properly express himself. Got angry. They had, after all, been disrupted after he finally got a chance to see his friend. Followed Red's mock charges with some of his own, clearly quite rusty but no longer apprehensive. Challenged Virus directly, approaching and taunting on more than one occasion, not necessarily a threatening adversary himself but certainly trying to be. He'd won fights back home. He'd frightened off predators. Why should this be any different?</p>
	
		<p>Made threat displays of his own, at one point having them returned upon him. Either injured himself or was injured, wasn't sure. Nothing serious. Farrah joined toward the end, which would have sucked if not for what followed.</p>
	
		<p>Things were not allowed to escalate beyond displays as Saosin wandered over, sniffed at Virus, then initiated another confrontation with The Red. With his lead gone, stone fled, knowing Virus outmatched him severely. Was not followed.</p>
	
		<p>Hid in some grasses, watching The Inferno and The Red, realizing only now what was happening. So, they were no longer equals. Watched Red get humiliated, feeling angry and humiliated himself merely by the scent signals. What an awful thing.</p>
	
		<p>Stayed nearby, bumping into a few deer here and there while he shifted uncomfortably, attempting to keep his distance while observing the two. The Inferno stood over The Red for some time, eventually taking his side when the hart slept. Eventually settled into the grass in the Birch near where he'd originally hid, falling asleep himself, though loyally remaining present while his friend was in the Forest. Thankfully, remained oblivious of spookies who innocently watched him sleep.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually, weariness got the best of him, and he settled into the Dark Place completely.</p>

		<p>Oh stone, if only you knew what Stria got up to today with those tiger-beings and your fallow friend. U gon b so mad. :3c</p>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke, under the slanted stone at the Playground. Not so swiftly realized he was, in fact, not alone, as there were a bunch of spookies (one of whom was sick and also Eliah was there) around. Spookied away.</p>
	
		<p>Went to the Pond, but to his distress found that it was even busier than the Playground. (Wat.) On top of that, almost everyone had some spooky article about them, ranging from skull masks to zombie antlers, and he didn't much like the looks of that. Stayed off to the side, checking out a few who were doing the same. One buck in particular caught his eye, as his set was pleasing and he seemed generally nice. Watched him for some time, observing three different parties come up and try to get his attention. Eventually he was shepherded away by a human-faced who seemed to be fighting with him. Stone followed to be certain he was alright, deduced they were likely friends, and returned to the Pond, disappointed.</p>
	
		<p>Realized he could always grab a drink and a bath from the stream, but there was a spooky (Farrah) up there too. Watched as she, conveniently, left. Then sprinted over to drink and bathe in record time before hurrying to the Blue Bowl. Settled in the thickest patch of brambles, finally thinking himself safe, when only moment later a stranger burst in and settled beside him as if they were old friends.  Virtually teleported away.</p>
	
		<p>Settled in the Birch near De Drinkplaats in blob-viewing range of a spooky. Thought this might be okay, but after some time, a burst of Magic thunder assured him otherwise. Again, got to his hooves, and sprinted away. (The more I've gotten in touch with deer the more we've become giant ninnies.) Settled in a thick patch of bramble in the Birch where he was left undisturbed for some time&mdash;but for the pretty spooky Lilu who was settled some distance away and put him off&mdash;and eventually fell asleep, travelling to the Dark Place to keep his body safe.</p>

			<h3><time datetime="2014-11-07">November 7, 2014</time></h3>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the Blue Bowl where he'd taken shelter during a particularly anxious bout. Lay there for some time, nibbling at berries (somehow) and bushes, ruminating. Started several times whenever he heard a skull-cry, or for no reason at all. Eventually became restless and went looking for company, hoping a herd would put his mind at ease.</p>
	
		<p>Approached the Pond, recognizing Thais from their meeting during the Rut. Though having no issue with her specifically, the human face and poison did more than put him off. Mostly, however, it was a skull-faced being while made him antsy, and so he danced around the Pond, wanting to bathe and drink, but constantly fleeing from the attentions of the skull-faced stranger. (U coward.) Eventually, was spooked and ran to the Playground, seeking shelter under the slanted rock. Hesitantly returned to the Pond not long after when he felt Muiel's Pictogram there, the stranger gone. Returned just as she left; watched her go.</p>
	
		<p>Drank and bathed quickly, gorging himself on plant matter before settling, kind of, at his spot on the Pond's edge. Repeatedly glanced to Thais, contemplating trying to garner company from her. Eventually, the flightiness won out, and he stood to take a casual drink or two before settling near her, a log between them. (So suave.) Was distressed to see her leave to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go not long after.</p>
	
		<p>Swiftly made his way back to the Blue Bowl, settling there for a few moments before a stranger spooked him. Fled again to the Playground, taking shelter under the slanted rock. It seemed quiet there today. Maybe no one would bother him.</p>
	
		<p>Delighted when Rhia turned up, though even then was wary. She smelled of flowers and hormones and that scent she tried so hard to hide, be it her diet or simply her genes which coded her need for it. Given his high levels of anxiety and their lack of recent contact, his instincts were working to get the better of him. Dress a predator up in pretty flowers and a nice attitude, it's still a predator. She'd hidden it from him, worked to never smell of death, which was enough to earn his closeness&mdash;still, he could not merely dismiss what he'd been encoded to run from, had run from all his life. She wasn't safe. No matter what he wanted, she wasn't safe.</p>
	
		<p>But friendship and her obvious pregnancy were enough to garner his sympathy. They groomed one another extensively to re-establish bonds. She tried so hard not to alarm him, he saw that. That was enough, for then. (As for when he sees those babies tho, lol. Gl stone.)</p>
	
		<p>Finally was calm enough to get some rest. In self-defense, slipped off to The Dark Place. Dreamed of predators which would not hunt, and young more chimaeric than he could understand.</p>

			<h3><time datetime="2014-10-26">October 26, 2014</time></h3>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Immediately scented for familiar beings, but caught no one. Elected to go on a trot-canter through the Birch. Bumped into a deer ([alhainen]) having a stare-down with a sitting pair (Leo and Freya). Recognized the doe in the pair as one he'd loosely guarded while lonely during the Rut. Liked the looks of the male, but was off-put by something about him. Elected to keep his distance.</p>
	
		<p>Swiftly realized the lone female smelled like excellent company. Pure deer&mdash;fallow, the Magic told him&mdash;clearly a recent mother, flighty in the way feral deer are. Oh, he was so happy. He let the hope get the best of him and made an attempt to befriend her, slowly advancing while keeping a neutral posture, giving space when space looked needed. Eventually, they got close enough to sniff, seemed to approve, and went about grazing near one another for an extended period of time. Just the sort of respite stone needed, he was brought to a state of extreme calm.</p>
	
		<p>Delighted when Rhia trotted up, he sniffed at her and took her side to ruminate, while the fallow doe watched from a distance and eventually settled, clearly apprehensive but trusting of his judgment of Rhia not to outright flee.</p>
	
		<p>Almost as quick as she came, he discovered Rhia to be gone. Disappointed, but happy the fallow remained, he drew closer to her and settled in the brush to continue ruminating.</p>
	
		<p>Zoning out, he regained awareness only to discover the fallow had left too! Luckily, he still could scent her and felt her Pictogram. He followed her and discovered her at the Pond, much to his delight. Even though his rumen was still almost entirely full and he'd barely gotten anything ruminated into even his second chamber, he swallowed down some water and soft water grasses. Noticing a full zombie set deer who walked on water, both he and the fallow decided to be done with the Pond.</p>
	
		<p>He scented Stria and felt her Pictogram, but around her he felt the Pictogram of Shahla, and he scented her as well as her fawns. Disgusted, he elected to keep his distance. He knew, in his mind, they would not hurt her. She was safe, despite what his instincts said. He elected not to rush to her defense for this, expressing his displeasure by simply not visiting her in her current company whatsoever. The tiger-hybrids smelled awful to him, and he'd not be in their company, no matter how friendly they were. (Stone you hypocrite you hang with Rhia. She's part, like, leopard. I know you don't have PTSD with those and she religiously covers herself in flowers to hide her scent, but come on, man.)
	
		<p>They sat together ruminating again for some time in the First Forest, interrupted only when a raven flew by and turned stone into a frog. Having slightly gotten used to being a frog from all the times he'd been in the deep side of the Pond lately, he did not panic so much as tiredly sigh and contemplate his frog-ness for a time before going to wash off the Magic. The fallow, meanwhile, was rather horrified at this development and, having not seen the raven, blamed the patch of grass on which they sat. When he returned to her, she had moved, and he was completely fine with that.</p>
	
		<p>Stria eventually hurried over, startling the fallow, and just as stone stood to greet her, another rushed over and turned him into a bat. Hung from one of Stria's antlers, muttering in a tiny bat voice over the whole shape-shifting thing. Soon flew to the Pond, again, to wash this off as well, leading Stria with him to wash her of the tiger scent. Coated himself and her with a mixture of water and mud before returning to the fallow, though lead Stria instead to a mass of hyacinths&mdash;both so as not to spook the fallow further and because he figured Stria would be more comfortable&mdash;where they ate, rolled in, and generally destroyed the flower patch. This confused the fallow enough to startle her off, which stone reluctantly allowed. All herd-ship took time.</p>
	
		<p>Satisfied with his level of flowery mud, stone eventually settled and allowed Stria to do her thing. He was already filthy, it really couldn't hurt. Comforted by the mock-grooming, he eventually settled off into sleep, and later into the Dark Place, where he dreamed of a flighty fallow doe who both charmed and eluded him.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Made his way to the Blue Bowl where he ate his fill of blueberries and blueberry bushes and curled in their cover to ruminate, settling on and off to nap.</p>

		<p>Became alert to the sound of hoof beats and stood just as Rhia appeared. Settled with her after a sniff and half-nuzzle, grooming her and guarding her and what have you for a while. It was rather uneventful, and he most definitely valued that. He scented Stria, but he knew she was fine, off doing Stria things. He decided, for once, to just let her be her own deer for a little while, while he hung out with his lady friend.</p>

		<p>When Rhia unceremoniously went to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go, he immediately stood and made his way to Stria, where he took his spot beside her. She eventually fell asleep but hung around, and so he lived up to his nick-namesake, “watcher.”</p>

		<p>Eventually, he went to where there was no one by accident, and found himself somewhere off in the Birch. Confused, but not upset, he waited for everyone to come back before sniffing Stria out. She was up and about (finally), doing Stria things. They romped about for a while (and I found a way to make deer pronk and it's hilarious and I couldn't stop so this went on hella long) and eventually stone couldn't anymore so they stopped. Kind of.</p>

		<p>Then Stria just left and so he did his best to follow. She proceeded to hide behind some tall rocks at the Playground, and he crept around, surprising her. They continued this game of hide-and-seek-ish thing for a while (and it was so cute and one of the only times I've seen characters be able to express themselves fully in the game and I can't) before booping noses through a crevice between two stones. Stone then went about catapulting himself off of a rock ramp at increasing velocities (dude you're gonna break a hip). Stria responded with a distinct “nope,” which only encouraged stone's own poor behaviour. He proceeded to climb the entire Playground up to the tallest rock, back up from the edge, and run-jump off. Stria probably thought he died, so he came back around the long way to show her he was fine. And jump off again.</p>

		<p>However, partway up, he saw a deer with huge antlers (username LolaKim) near Stria. How aBOUT NO BACK UP. Scrambled around the rocks and onto the tallest in record time, giving the stranger a Hard Stare right away. Was responded to with an Antler Threat, though didn't want to escalate to a fight. Gave a Taunt to make it clear that he wouldn't stand down while Stria was nearby. However, Stria, in a fit of clever mischievousness, had sneaked around behind the stranger&hellip;</p>

		<p>And proceeded to antler him right in the butt. Surprised, he jumped and turned to glance behind him while she <em>bolted</em> off. Clearly displeased, he turned back to stone and issued another Antler Threat. Glanced at the deer, up at the massive antlers, and over to Stria, who was already far away and well in the clear. Calmly noped out of that situation, pride immediately folding in the face of keeping himself and his charge safe. Nuzzled her and told her what an astounding, wonderful job she'd done. "That was very clever of you." He was so, so proud of her.</p>

		<p>Continued to hang out for a bit, Ruuning around into the First Forest where Stria nibbled at some mushrooms. Still wary of the Spell they'd give him, stone tried some as well, and found that if he pretended it wasn't happening really hard, they were almost worth eating.</p>

		<p>Then, abruptly, someone Stria seemed to know (Grete) popped up. Stone, very much liking mythological creatures of the neutral persuasion, immediately took to her, which was his first mistake. (She's a troll, stone. A <em>troll</em>.) Virtually immediately got hit with a Mask Spell. Thought he'd be able to handle it&mdash;was wrong. Rather than give him a mask, it took away his face, and replaced it with a human face. He took a bit to comprehend this, growing steadily more and more horrified. Painfully smooshed his face into the mushroom tree, not really sure what to do about this but wanting to hide how disgusting it was and hoping it would just fix itself. Grete, however, thought her work was hilarious and cast an Antler Spell on him too, covering his head and antlers in peacock feathers. Stria just wanted to touch the weird face.</p>

		<p>Overwhelmed by the amount of wrong going on, he did his best to rub off the offending feathers, then mashed his face back into the tree, pouting and steadily growing more and more alarmed. He was actually, technically, having a panic attack and after Stria got distracted with a Mask Spell of her own, and Grete vanished (dat disconnect lol I feel you Unplugged), he escalated straight into terror and absolutely bolted for the Pond. Not even taking a moment to gently wade in as he always had before, he took a flying leap into the water from its highest bank, splashing in and being turned into a frog. Though still awful, this was an improvement, and for a moment he just basked in not having that awful face anymore. Swum out of the water, cleared of Magic (and reloaded his set lol, always weird to see him naked when it's not my headcanon) but not feeling right. Dunked his head into the water repeatedly, shaking and dunking and so on while Stria and Grete caught up. They both didn't seem to know what to make of him, while he just basically crawled into Stria, repeatedly nuzzling and shaking to comfort himself. He spooked Stria quite a bit, and she withdrew from contact, attempting to shield herself from his chaotic mood. The whites of his eyes showing, flesh quivering, he dragged himself back into the water as deep as he could go, lying down so every time he exhaled, bubbles formed at his nostrils. For a long time, his mind was blank, as he merely experienced what happened to him almost as if from an outside perspective. Stria had no idea what to do, and set about dragging stones from the shoreline to plop beside him (because that would totally help to calm him down). It was this splashing and her bugle which eventually brought him back enough to drag himself to her instead, a bit out of the water. He sat snugged up to her chest for a long while, gradually getting a hold of himself once more.</p>

		<p>A hazy memory of the event still preserved but largely ignored, he took no issue with the troll child still, and paid her greeting before sitting on the shore to dry. Stria, still concerned, continued to collect stones for him, which he swiftly turned to cairns for her, thinking that was what she wanted.</p>

		<p>Eventually, they settled back together, others coming and going. Kio joined them, and he thought she was odd but harmless, so he sat off to the side, intending to let her and Stria play without being in the way. Thought it was sweet when Kio sat on the other side of the tree he'd taken shelter under, Stria taking his side, stretched to hold her head near her friend. Dozed, exhausted from the day. Fell asleep at Stria's side.</p>

			<p>Bye Rut. ;-; I'll miss you. Until next year, old friend. You were my favourite yet. (I didn't even get to see one fight, lol.)</p>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the Birch (barely). Hardly had gotten to his hooves when he noticed The Red only a stone's throw away (lol). Was very excited, then glanced left and saw Saosin. He had seen him once before near The Red's last harem, and had been spookied then. Was again spookied&mdash;those are some big antlers you got there friend, and are those <em>two mouths</em>. He did smell alright at least, albeit strange, and The Red seemed to trust him, and he was being very tender with his small, human-faced friend (Jettem). So, when he came over, stone sniffed him, gathering what information he could. His cowardice and caution overcoming him, though, he still backed up quite excessively, making it clear he wanted no trouble and would be none himself. Jettem then came to sniff and that was better&mdash;he could almost ignore the human face because it at least still had fur and didn't look quite like the humans at home. Still, he favoured caution, and so he backed from her too. (Poor things, tryin' to be nice to some nervous ass old poop.)</p>

		<p>He, The Red, The Inferno, and Jettem all shifted around for a while, The Red trying to convince stone not to be a wuss, stone being a wuss, and the red-furred duo watching occasionally but mostly politely keeping to themselves. Stone eventually almost settled enough to graze a few times, but each time, The Inferno chose to move (innocently) closer for one reason or another, and each time it spooked stone right back into his antsy foot-shifting, quiet snorting behaviour.</p>

		<p>Some others came around, including a fawn who really liked to play and use spells and seemed to think The Red and stone were its parents. Saosin and Jettem eventually left together, The Red having failed in coaxing the stubbornly cautious stone into closeness to The Inferno before he went. The Red then booked it so fast he basically disappeared in an effort to lose the overly-friendly, needy fawn. Stone, in an odd mood, didn't mind it, and went about grazing while the fawn did fawn things. Soon enough, it got bored and followed after some ill-fated passer-by. Stone made his way back to The Red.</p>

		<p>They sat together on Red Hill&mdash;stone lazily chewing his cud&mdash;with Jettem and a sleeping Saosin a ways away for a while, when someone came by and The Red led stone away. Jettem, Saosin, and The Red all standing was spooky enough, so stone followed with no hesitation. The dude seemed to take some issue with them, and Spelled The Red removing his antlers. Then he got stone, but actually <em>gave</em> his larger antlers. Joke's on him. After he left, stone got over the moment of triumph at having lucked out with big, scary antlers and realized he wasn't sure how to get them off or how this even worked. After butting at a tree for a while, he managed to knock them both off&mdash;his own antlers still in place&mdash;and took one in his mouth to chew on later. The Red then snatched the other one and darted off to hide it <s>because he's a little shit</s> in play. Stone, not really understanding that it was a playful act, thought he might be storing it for later when he needed calcium, or something of the sort.</p>

		<p>Approaching the Blue Bowl for the first time since the Joro incident, stone was a little apprehensive. However, nothing smelled off about the place, so with renewed trust and enthusiasm, he bounded into the berries, hopping about like a fawn in an attempt to cover his scent with the scent of berries. What better way to spend an afternoon than hidden in a thicket of berries, smelling of berries, chewing one's cud and a discarded antler. None. There is no better way.</p>

		<p>Soon, too soon, The Red led stone back to Red Hill. Bye, cozy berry thicket. They rejoined the red-furred duo&mdash;Jettem now asleep and Saosin awake&mdash;and stone nodded politely to them before settling to continue chewing. Despite looking spooky, he seemed okay. If The Red trusted him, he couldn't be awful.</p>

		<p>They continued about this way for some time until Rhia showed up. Unabashedly, she exchanged sniffs with The Inferno and bows with The Red, then stood at stone's side and allowed some greeting grooming before leading him off a short distance to sit with her. He continued grooming, a forming habit between him and pretty ladies, until eventually she fell asleep. The Red and Saosin, who had been grooming and playing, went off somewhere to do manly things while stone chewed and was generally boring. Eventually, he bored himself into falling asleep as well. The Dark Place took him.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest. Stria and Rune's scents were long gone and their Pictograms were nowhere to be sensed. Stone did, however, scent The Red, and so he made his way to him.</p>
	
		<p>The Red slept in the Birch Forest, alone. Stone took his distant side and actually fell back asleep himself for some time. Eventually, they both <s>stopped being lazy old dudes</s> woke up, and The Red led stone to a giant, human-faced moose-like being (Ephiré) and stone was spookied as heck when he woke up. Even if he wasn't <em>absolutely massive</em>, he smelled like people and the environments of people, and that was at least something to be wary of. Considering The Red trusted him, he mustered up some courage to offer a courtesy sniff, but quickly withdrew himself and sat at some distance from the pair. Over time, he came to at least tolerate Ephiré, since he seemed profoundly calm. Still, kind of spooky.</p>
	
		<p>He watched others trickle into the group which swiftly grew to obviously be The Red's harem for the day. The group ultimately ended up including Verve, Thais, Djinn, and Kauna, and most definitely some others (though I didn't find any other names). Thais tried to be polite and sniff at him, but when he happily returned the sniffs (trying to ignore the human face thing, which he may never get over), he immediately detected something wrong with her&mdash;the poison&mdash;and backed out of it, snorting to clear his nostrils of the sweet, toxic scent. Shortly afterward, Djinn and Kauna both came over to smell at him, and he was positively overwhelmed. He hadn't had so much attractive female attention since he himself had a harem years ago. He awkwardly stood between them, glancing back and forth, before The Red came and convinced them back to where they had been sitting. Stone kept his distance fairly well, occasionally being visited by The Red and honestly wondering why&mdash;after all, in his mind, they were technically competitors. Did very much enjoy the attention, especially after a fawn Pelt Spelled him into monarch butterfly scales. Being quite far from the Pond and not wanting to spare the trip, he did his best to shake, groom, and rub them off, but to no avail. Ultimately, The Red took pity on him and helped groom them off. <s>Thx bud ily.</s> Magic is the worst but at least it's usually fixable.</p>
	
		<p>Cleared straight out when a competitor (didn't catch the name&mdash;skull mask, magpie pelt, default antlers?) approached, not wanting to get caught up in fighting while he was unequipped to do so. It was swiftly made clear, however, that the competitor did not want a fight, so The Red scent marked him. Talk about "if you can't beat 'em, join em'."</p>
	
		<p>Witnessed another stag (no character) come up and repeatedly bellow, wincing to himself every time. The Red was having none of it, and eventually he got chased off.</p>
	
		<p>Spent his time grazing on and off, watching the harem from the outskirts. Eventually nodded off again, only to be awoken by scent input. Rhia? He glanced up, noticing she was just by The Red at the center of his harem. Had sort of mixed feelings&mdash;wanted her to be over with him, and maybe <em>just</em> him, but knew The Red was the dominant hart at this point. Not to mention he wouldn't even breed with her, even if she'd been receptive. Still, he felt a little jealous. What a strange emotion.</p>
	
		<p>Luckily for him, she came to greet him when he stood. Awkwardly sniffed her, still not at the point to feel comfortable giving full-fledged nuzzles. The Red then came over and shoved stone's butt (nice vocabulary usage, stone!) with his antlers. ??? Why happening? Red what are you doing??? Red I don't understand. Proceeded to continue not understanding before getting shoved forward once more. Looked back at The Red, who slowly followed him, and ran a little bit ahead every time The Red got close enough to shove him again. Was not fond of the shoving. Rhia just watched the entire thing, impatient with stone for his hesitance. (She wanted both of the booties and this was taking far too long.) Eventually determined that The Red was shoving stone into the harem to join it. This may have raised more questions than answers, but he just went along with it, scooting around Rhia and giving The Red a sort of, "okay, I'm here, please stop head butting my butt ):" look. Did not get scent marked, but was clearly welcomed amongst the group. Actually, Rhia and The Red were the only ones to acknowledge him from then on. That was fine.</p>
	
		<p>Sat with the very sleepy Rhia for a while, then stood to continue grazing around the area. Noticed some stag (no character again, different one) snuffling about the area. Was a little tense, but then he got too close to Rhia, and stone felt the need to hurry over to her and stand at her side. Stayed like this for some time, eventually sitting, then falling asleep. Woke up when Rhia abruptly got up, scurried behind a tree, and glared at him, noticing she seemed to be a little more green than she was before. Figured she must have been Pelt Spammed by the fawn who got him earlier, and felt just awful. Maybe she'd never been hit with Magic, or maybe it'd been a long time and she'd forgotten how gross it is. Either way, he totally understood how she felt, and he didn't bug her about it. He felt cranky after getting spelled too. He thought her reaction to him was a little misplaced, but he sympathized and went back to grazing around while she skirted about. (What he didn't realize, and never came to understand, is that she thought it was him. This is hilarious, and one day maybe they'll straighten that up.) Again, eventually, he took her side, and fell asleep snugged into the crook of her neck. Even when she awoke, she tolerated him, tired of being angry.</p>
	
		<p>At one point, he noticed someone kind of frightening (Pandora) sitting on a hill adjacent to them, so he sat facing her until she left to be sure she wouldn't try sneaking up on them. She didn't. (She didn't seem interested at all. He's just being overprotective.)</p>
	
		<p>Then something magical happened. He noticed two deer wandering up to him and Rhia, and something was&hellip; Familiar, about the smaller one. Squinted, though it clarified nothing. When she approached, her sniffed the air, and he <em>knew</em> he'd met this doe before&hellip; She was so familiar. They sniffed one another and oh my soul it's Khuna.</p>
	
		<p>They basically had a party. Khuna's friend, Eilir, nodded to them and sat down, clearly aware that they needed some time. She certainly remembered something of him as they both basically freaked out and nuzzled one another raw. She'd gotten so big! I mean, she was still tiny, but so much bigger! She looked so healthy and her fur had darkened up a little and he was just so excited to see that H.'s fawns had all made it this year. Sure he'd scented what he thought was her on Stria, but he couldn't know for sure&mdash;but now he did! Ah, after that almost all of his general tensions just completely eased up. The meeting was fairly brief, him grooming her for a while before she and her friend left. But that was fine. He didn't have anything to do or say really&mdash;maybe because he had too much to do any say&mdash;he was just happy to see her.</p>
	
		<p>As soon as they left, Rhia <em>also</em> left. He was a little disappointed for a bit before he realized he could go wallow in the Pond, which perked him right up, and so he did. He got an excellent layer of mud on himself, gorged himself on water plants and drank himself silly, then lay in the water to soak. Nothing better than a good wallowing session. He'd missed this. While wallowing, he built a single cairn with the small hoard of stones he'd accidentally built up over time at the space on the shore he always seemed to find himself coming to. He then fell asleep, and went to The Dark Place.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest, where he'd fallen asleep beside Stria before. Stood and stretched, not really thinking of anything in particular.</p>
	
		<p>Glanced over only to see Rhia sitting on the Pond's hilly bank, watching the fish. Made his way over to say howdy.</p>
	
		<p>Said howdy. Well, would have, but she fell asleep. He waited around as politely as you can when staring at someone, waiting for them to wake up. Some stag ran by and sat under a tree a bit away and it was weird, but he tried to ignore it. (It didn't work; it was too weird.) Soon, Rhia woke up and, after side-eyeing stone a little, they greeted one another with snuffling and half-nuzzles. Then everybody left.</p>
	
		<p>Really, everybody just left, leaving him in Limbo. One moment, they were there&mdash;the next, everyone was gone. (Dat disconnect lol.) Was a little puzzled, then decided to just let it happen. Stood, waiting for everyone to just come back&mdash;which they did. Some problems really do just fix themselves.</p>
	
		<p>Trotted after Rhia who seemed to have been chased by that weird stag, when <em>she</em> disappeared. Just kind of stood there waiting for that to fix itself too.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually, he heard her call from somewhere in the Birch. You know what? Okay, that's cool. He ran to meet her and her groomed her for<s>, like, ever</s> a while. Accidentally touched <s>dat fine booty</s> her "butt" and had to be explained what that is, as his concept of what's a no-no back there pretty much only extends to reproductive organs without consent and maybe the orifices at the end of the digestive system. Understanding that this "butt" was a personal space, apparently, he continued grooming without issue. <s>Non-fully-ferals are weird.</s></p>
	
		<p>She led him further into the Birch where they semi-snuggled and passed time by existing. Eventually, she fell asleep, and he noticed Stria somewhere in the Forest. Not wanting to be rude, but desperately wanting to visit Stria, he sneaked away. (Which is good, because she was hungry and needed to hunt, and stone will have a kitten when he finds out about her diet.)</p>
	
		<p>Stria was hanging with a pretty cute young doe (Yoko) who stone was totally chill with, for once. Naturally, he accidentally scared the heck out of her, and felt pretty awful after she darted to partially hide behind a tree. He increased the distance to show he wasn't bad, and Stria did her best to reassure the smaller deer. <s>Shhh bby it ok.</s></p>
	
		<p>Then, a deer appeared. (Peregryn.) Just, out of nothing. Again, stone decided to just let it happen. What are you even gonna do here.</p>
	
		<p>It turned out she and Yoko are basically BFFs and they're both extremely lovely deer who stone condones Stria hanging around 100%. They chilled a little. Stone ended up zoning out pretty hardcore.</p>
	
		<p>When he came to, Stria was up and he was startled before he realized she and Rune were <s>Ruuning around more destructively than hurricanes</s> playing right nearby. More than delighted to see the both of them at once for the first time since Stria was born (I think), he joined in right away.</p>
	
		<p>Then everything got intense.</p>
	
		<p>Some big stag-thing (Former) and a smaller one (nicknamed goldy) showed up and stone was having none of that. Blindly intervened between the two and his charges. Once he got close enough to Former, he realized the scent&mdash;beyond the disgusting smell of death&mdash;was too similar to Stria's to be coincidental. So, this was her father. He struggled to really believe that. Reluctantly, he let up, only standing beside his charges, though Rune was still having none of it. He was actually super proud of Rune for confronting Former. Though it was foolish of the buck to even attempt, Rune had a good H.. In the heat of it, stone realized something: "Maybe they don't need me anymore." Contrary to how a human might feel, for an animal, this is the happiest realization one can have about their charges. Even without stone or H. or anyone, maybe they would be fine. Maybe, in a way, though they were still babies, they were grown-ups now too.</p>
	
		<p>Begrudgingly allowed Stria to sniff at her father (not sure why she'd want to do that, he smelled awful). Noticed she was really uncertain of how to behave, and remained absolutely tense during the entire visit, ready to act at the slightest issue.</p>
	
		<p>Some others joined the group (of Stria, Yoko, stone, Peregryn, Rune, and the extras Former and goldy and maybe some others) including Muiel (haaayyy, greeted her pretty happily) and Sloane (didn't mind). It was chaotic enough to really make stone antsy. First time since the Joro incident.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually, the cloud of strange newcomers dissipated, Former leaving with them. Stone was relieved. He settled beside Rune, allowing Stria to stay nestled with Muiel, Sloane, and Yoko. He played a little with Rune, but mostly watched the buck interact with Peregryn (and Yoko, I think). He kind of lost track of things, lost in thought now that there wasn't anything immediately spooky. He became convinced that something had happened to Former between when he had bred H. and now&mdash;she would never have allowed herself to be bred by something of that sort. He smelled of blood and death, and something about him was that of a cat&mdash;a lion, the Magic corrected, and something called a demon. No, definitely not. He may have been Stria and Khuna's father, but something had changed, and now stone was intent on keeping him from being a bad influence on his charges. After all, if that had somehow happened to him, how could he know they would be safe?</p>
	
		<p>Eventually, Stria joined him, and they formed a pile with Rune, who was eventually asleep. They all settled. The group dwindled down further, Yoko and Peregryn falling into Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go (regrettably), until only Muiel and Sloane remained near a tree just beside the three. Several times, stone wanted to find Rhia, to at least excuse himself if not outright invite her, but an opportunity did not present itself, and after all that tension, he just wanted to lay with his charges for a while and be safe. He excused himself of that responsibility. She would understand&mdash;she was certainly independent enough. Still, he kind of missed her.</p>
	
		<p>Several times, different strangers passed, being loud or rude and it irritated him more than usual (testosterone). He stood each time, not wasting a moment on pleasantries, and stared them all down, his body straight in a challenge or threat, whatever they chose. None seemed to understand, but they all passed eventually. He was not having anything near Stria and Rune, not anymore, not today. He knew it was just The Rut, but he would do anything to keep them safe, and quickly.</p>
	
		<p>Watched Muiel wander off toward the Pond and felt kind of sad. He'd come to value her company, if anything because she always seemed so in-charge of what was going on around her, detached in a rather noble way, and he knew she'd get whatever she wanted. He saw she cared about Stria, and he wanted his charges as safe as they could be&mdash;it did not matter who protected them (unless it was Former, lol).</p>
	
		<p>As if to prove his comfort, Muiel eventually wandered back, but was stopped by a fawn. She was completely kind to it, and even played. Bad things did not typically do that. He'd never forget how they first met, and he might always be a little suspicious, but he was almost entirely over any feelings of apprehension. (tl;dr Muiel is a pretty chill bro.)
	
		<p>Eventually, finally, settled down enough to rest. While laying with his charges&mdash;Rune between he and Stria who were facing opposite directions&mdash;he remembered something that felt so long ago: <em>Stone is sitting in the Birch, H. is at his side and all is well. The fawns, two of them, are healthy enough. H. has accepted Rune into her brood, and stone knows he will be safe and well-fed from now on. He and the Hind sit close together, each facing opposite directions, and between them all three fawns lay, nuzzled against H.'s belly, nursing. This moment is perfect. Everything is right.</em></p>
	
		<p>How time flies. Stria was as big as he now, and still growing every day. Rune, though bound to always be small, defended his sister today. Stone lay down his head on some grass, nearly overcome by emotion. He was not meant to feel so much, and yet. And as angry as he was with the Magic, as frustrated with this place, as frightened and lonesome and wronged as he was, he wouldn't change a thing now. He would have, before. But he's changed. And he thinks it's for the better.</p>
	
		<p>Caught up in his thoughts, he's lulled to sleep. His love for his charges, his desire to protect and care for them as long as he can, keeps him; even in sleep, rather than let his body go to The Dark Place, he slumbers, Stria and Rune at his side.</p>

		<p>Awoke, to no one. Moved about the Forest, wondering why it was so empty. Realized he must be in Limbo again, and made himself comfortable while he waited. Not long afterward, he glanced up and found himself in company, as if nothing had happened. Scented Stria and sensed her Pictogram&mdash;went to her.</p>
	
		<p>Found her alright, sitting with Muiel and a new doe (Ehretia), but she seemed a little out of it. (Wind pls, watchin' vidya games from ur bed. U have Strias 2 play get w/ the times jeez.) Decided to go check on a cute little thing who was all by her lonesome in the Birch (Freya), well, aside from Greitai and another less-than-trustable thing (Soét). Wanted to be sure they weren't going to cause the doe trouble. When he got there, she seemed safe enough, but she was in just as much of a daze as Stria. He took her side at a minor distance to be polite. A while later, when nothing had happened, he elected to go check on Stria again.</p>
	
		<p>This time, she was active (and smelled gross and Shahla-y). She, Muiel, and Ehretia all stood, her looking kind of uncomfortable. Stone did his best to provide moral support&mdash;just kidding, he sneaked up on her and made her jump. It was awesome.</p>
	
		<p>They kind of stood around awkwardly for a while before stone got distracted. He came back around to see the three of them sitting off together in some flowers&mdash;perhaps Muiel wasn't so awful after all, maybe it had just been Joro&mdash;and sat at a bit of distance to keep the two he didn't know comfortable.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually, stone took Stria's side, Mashing up some flowers in his teeth and rubbing it on her to cover the gross tiger-y smell. There, much better. Noticed a beast (Vasilisa) lurking at just the wrong distance away, obscured partially by a tree. Stood to face the being in a display, intending to convey something like <em>I can see you. Don't dare approach me or those with me.</em> Even though he had mixed feelings on Muiel and didn't know Ehretia, he would not allow some predator to move about them brazenly. He knew the testosterone was affecting his judgment, but that didn't mean he was wrong. Soon after, Stria noticed him staring and took up his side, also facing down the beast. He took the time to impart a bit of knowledge: "I don't condone your habits of hanging around those who would kill and eat your kin, but if they are kind, I cannot fault you. This, however, this is something to always be on your guard for. You learn this well Stria: do not trust those who watch you from a hidden place." She got the message.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually, Ehretia and then Muiel stood, and they began to play. Though Stria was a little zoned out, stone found himself lured into the silliness and joined in, hopping about with them with only a mild slowness to his step. When Stria eventually came to and joined in, he noticeably perked up. However, he eventually wore himself out, and ended up just walking after her until she calmed down.</p>
	
		<p>Stria settled and he stood over her, still wary of the beast. Muiel and Ehretia seemed to pay it no mind, sitting together some distance away. Perhaps they hadn't noticed it, or perhaps it wasn't a threat&mdash;either way, he wasn't keen on risking anything.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually, Stria stood, and he deemed this a good time to sleep a bit himself.</p>
	
		<p>So he did.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest, where he'd fallen asleep beside Stria. Her scent long gone, he immediately listened and scented for familiar faces.</p>
	
		<p>Immediately detected a huge group a ways away&mdash;importantly noting the presence of The Red and Rhia. Hurried over to find... Joro? Oh. Missed her name and scent.</p>
	
		<p>Slinked around the group, eyeing Rhia fairly at its center, The Red standing and facing some stag or another. This would be tricky.</p>
	
		<p>As if to prove his caution correct, Joro immediately turned to face him. Perceiving no coincidence in that, he increased the distance. Sitting down to feign comfort, eyeing the group, he considered his options. He was surprised when two folks (not sure who&mdash;I'm told the larger one was a horse and the mini was a canine hybrid?) ambled over to investigate him. Greeted them politely with sniffs, scowling a bit at the canine-ness of the larger but too distracted by Joro to be very apprehensive. Soon after, they left, and he began to circle back around, looking for a way to at least catch Rhia's attention.</p>
	
		<p>Carefully scaling a small Playground rock, he lay back down again, watching her across the distance. To his delight, she stood, and he went to meet her while still keeping his distance from the rest of the group. They sniffed, and she lay beside the stone. Remembering how anxious she was about him standing for long periods, he took her side, head over her back to watch Joro. As his first words to Rhia, he commented almost to himself: "How do they get so big." After some interaction within the group, Joro seemed to decide to leave him alone, so he turned his attention almost entirely on Rhia, and watching The Red from a distance.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually, The Red made his way to the both of them, and stone immediately hopped to his hooves and greeted with a sniff and weird pseudo-groom. Rhia glanced at The Red and climbed the rock to sit there, back mostly to the pair of stags. (Gurl you can't feign disinterest&mdash;u no dey both fiiiiine.) Both deer climbed the rock to join her&mdash;The Red far more gracefully than stone&mdash;and sat atop it, stone between the two of them. They sat this way for some time, stone making idle remarks occasionally because he enjoyed their company and it was a bad habit, with them remaining in silence. Eventually, the discomfort of his company brought him back to lay down, though he still watched.</p>
	
		<p>Some time later, The Red stood and they shared a clear, concise, polite <em>goodbye</em> before he trotted off. Stone immediately moved in to groom Rhia, which she reciprocated, noticing finally that Joro was gone. They continued on in silence for some time, taking enjoyment merely from the presence of the other. While he was so close to her, he observed her build: strong, somewhat front-heavy, young but developing well. He knew then that there was definitely something odd about her, and it was not that she had horns&mdash;unlike deer&mdash;or that she wore flowers or even the way she aloofly carried herself, seeming much more human than he. He had only seen the front-heavy musculature she possessed on predators, particularly the big cats of his homeland. She was nice enough; she smelled of flowers, not of death, but he couldn't dismiss the fact.</p>
	
		<p>Still, he had no reason to flee, to abandon her. And he really did enjoy her company. He supposed there was no harm in it if he was careful. But a part of him still cautioned him to run.</p>
	
		<p>He ignored that part. Poor decision or otherwise. Like he'd been discussing with Rune, maybe it wasn't all bad. Maybe even some predators could be friends.</p>
	
		<p>He hoped.</p>
	
		<p>As he considered these things, he slumped at her side, falling asleep atop the rock near the Playground.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, where he'd left Rune near The Red's hills.</p>
	
		<p>Wandered around for several hours, staying in the company of active groups but not attracting the attention of any individual.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually settled atop the largest Playground stone for a moment, before noticing an <em>absolutely massive beast</em> (Chrona) asleep but a few strides away. Quietly noped out.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually meandered his way back to the Pond where he drank and groomed and generally tottled about. Was about to make his way nowhere in particular when he realized a deer&mdash;a doe?&mdash;had been staring at him from beneath a willow tree. (Rhiannon.) Turned to, politely, stare back. A doe indeed, as her scent indicated.</p>
	
		<p>Though his own Rut was months away and he was anything but impressive in his velvet, and though he was quite old by deer standards and thought he would never breed again once his harem had been taken from him a handful of years ago and he had been unable to regain it, he was attracted to her. And so, his odd attempt at courting began.</p>
	
		<p>Calmly approached her, keeping his body language friendly but attentive. He very slowly made his way closer, and settled a couple body lengths from her side, watching her from the corner of his eye. This was a quiet time, where they evaluated one another without conversation. He liked that, liked her.</p>
	
		<p>She stood to drink from the Pond, and he followed, leaping into its waters from its edge. He remembered females tended to be impressed by energetic and immature displays of strength and agility. He turned to her, but she mostly looked horrified. Not of him though, as he concluded from her behaviour&mdash;she feared the water. How strange.</p>
	
		<p>But, the Magic pressed, there was some reason to her fear. At that, he accepted it, not interested in knowing more.</p>
	
		<p>As they exited the water, they were ambushed by a fawn. Two fawns. Three. And an adult. He greeted them (OOCly with a bow&mdash;gotta be polite, his body language doesn't seem very friendly). Alas, that fawns were loud, louder than he knew how to react to, and they followed. He tried to follow Rhia, but the fawns followed him. Reluctantly, he watched her slink away into the Forest, sacrificing himself to the mercy of the MAAAAAAAAAAHs. At least she was free.</p>
	
		<p>After they'd lost interest, he made his way after her scent, toward her Pictogram. And there she was, laying amidst the flowers at the base of a tree. He stood to graze a few body lengths beside her, when he noticed her stand and turn her back to him, her face obscured by the tree entirely. Impressed by her degree of trust in him, he took this as quite a compliment (stone pls) and happily resumed grazing, eager to fill the place of a trusted herd member. Not long after, her voice came from around the tree. "Please sit down if you are going to stay. I'd rather not have to keep my eyes open any longer." So that he did, without a response of his own. He did, however, continue grazing&mdash;he'd not eaten much thus far today.</p>
	
		<p>He watched her falling asleep as he grazed, intent on staying alert to be certain she slept safely. Alas, his wandering mind must have gotten the better of him, because suddenly Stria was all up in his business. (Stria pls don't be such a cockblock u ho.) With a silent sigh, he nuzzled her, noting that Rhia was very much still awake and had registered Stria's arrival with not so much as a raise of her head. Clearly she did not know what a terror Stria could be. He hoped it'd stay that way.</p>
	
		<p>Some time later, he watched her vanish in a puff of purple smoke. Not much at all later, he himself dozed off, leaving Stria incredibly disappointed but eerily patient with the old stag. Waking just enough to drag his face to rest over her shoulders, he slept for some time, and she remained uncharacteristically well behaved. At least, to his awareness.</p>
	
		<p>After he'd rested enough, Stria coaxed him into playing, and play he did. Uneventful but fun. He stopped when he grew fatigued&mdash;Stria managed to make herself so dizzy she needed to lay down and hang on. He stood over her while she considered her mistakes at great length.</p>
	
		<p>Eventually, he settled at her side and went to sleep.</p>
	
		<p>The Dark Place was full of visions of Rhia, looking back at him before coyly Ruuning off.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the Blue Bowl. Surrounded by others. Left as quickly as he could.</p>

		<p>Conveniently, Stria was among the group. Immediately was joined by her and led back to them. Saw an absolutely towering figure in the berries (Jorogumo) and caught her scent&mdash;did not bode well. Very, very much wanted to keep his distance.</p>

		<p>Stria, in her characteristic magnetism for trouble, made her most sincere effort at luring him into the Blue Bowl toward the group. Reluctantly, he slowly approached, fleeing when Joro stood to face him but eventually returning.</p>

		<p>Fled again once Muiel approached, allowing Stria near her though keeping a close eye on them. Once Joro stood, however, sprinted to Stria to stand over her. Should things go poorly, at least his injury or death might give her time to flee. Jorogumo alone stood well above him, and at more than six times his weight. This was foolish.</p>

		<p>Sniffed at them to be polite, but his apprehension was more than obvious. Realized Joro was distinctly aware of this when she spelled him and mocked a charge or two&mdash;wasn't sure if she was just toying with him or actually making a point of telling him off and sure didn't stick around to find out. He and Stria were out as fast as they could manage.</p>

		<p>Some distance away when Stria stopped, he nudged her on. She seemed uncharacteristically apologetic, but perhaps his degree of anxiety was simply that moving. Indeed, he was absolutely, visibly shaken.</p>

		<p>Finally allowed himself to be disgusted by the Pelt Spell once they'd nearly arrived at the Pond. Wondered briefly at how anything could allow itself to be covered in scales as he plucked them off in the Pond, utilizing its Magic-cleansing capacity as he usually did.</p>

		<p>Groomed Stria extensively to calm his nerves. Eventually followed her back to the Birch (and near The Red, though they did not meet) where they briefly met a stag who nuzzled before sniffing and left as quickly as he arrived. Confused, but ultimately just happy he'd been amiable, stone groomed Stria while staying on his feet. Sometime later, eventually settled down enough to allow himself to sit and rest his muscles&mdash;which were not used to so much activity and already stiffening with soreness. Continued grooming her for easily an hour or more.</p>
	
		<p>Mulling over the experience, really grew to dislike Jorogumo. His own health was one thing&mdash;he's been chased off a thousand times, beaten up, worse. To even mock a charge around Stria, however, that was a problem. Will always avoid Joro&mdash;he isn't stupid, she's absolutely gargantuan&mdash;but always with a begrudging sense of near-loathing. How dare she act so aggressively in the presence of Stria, who clearly liked her. At least her friend had been polite&mdash;antsy, but polite&mdash;but Joro's behaviour was unacceptable.</p>

		<p>Abruptly realized that exercise helps to rid the body of excess adrenaline and challenged Stria to some sort of race by just Ruuning away without warning. This ended with them scaling the Playground and being <s>totally badass</s> complete dorks by bugling and generally making alpha tools of themselves.</p>

		<p>Snuggled up together atop the Playground, feeling significantly better with the stress hormone out of his system. Wary of others still, Joro's pictogram permanently seared into his mind, but finally calm.</p>

		<p>Followed Stria to The Red and Djinn. Was immediately delighted to see another feral being&mdash;the first since Stria and her children, to his recollection. (He is, admittedly, super stoked to see another feral, especially a male. He didn't realize it, but he'd really, really missed seeing just… Deer.) Snuffled both politely, paying careful attention to The Red's rut and impressive antlers. With his own being laughable and himself being far from his own Rut, was more than happy to step aside to not appear as a competitor to the hart's harem. In fact, very much in support of The Red's harem and breeding potential. Encouraged Stria to join him and rough-house with him while he rested his weary muscles.</p>

		<p>Was, again, lured off by Stria to just stand around in the First Forest near Red Hill for a while, lazily grooming. Admired The Red at a distance. (I think he's got a brocrush. Looks like I have a new FriendShip.)</p>

		<p>Was challenged to a spar by Stria and, after finally understanding that, yes, she was <em>challenging</em> him, reluctantly accepted. Whooped her something good and taught her a thing or two along the way. Didn't lay an antler against her, but taught her a bit about intimidation, avoidance, and trickery.</p>

		<p>Hung out with her a bit longer before she rejoined The Red's harem, sitting with Djinn. Watched fondly from afar for some time while constructing a cairn to occupy himself. Eventually, settled down entirely, venturing off to the Dark Place.</p>
	
		<p>Awoke, in the First Forest, near Red Hill. Scented the air briefly, "feeling" for Pictograms as he did so. Didn't sense Stria or the rest of the family, so simply gave up and settled to work on a cairn.</p>
	
		<p>Was most surprised when he glanced up some time later to see The Red at his side. Perhaps he'd been more absorbed in his work than he'd intended.</p>
	
		<p>Perceived The Red's closeness as some sort of invitation. So, when The Red began a walk toward the Crying Idol, stone followed in suit, though less gracefully as his limbs were stiff from all the Ruuning he'd done in his earlier bout of wakefulness.</p>
	
		<p>Followed at a respectful distance as The Red seemed to examine various groups up close, mark himself with musk, and otherwise do very hart-y things. Refused to tread upon Red Hill, scenting a great deal of The Red's time was spent here and not wanting to seem confrontational. Though he stood just slightly taller than The Red, the hart had the weight advantage, and his antlers and battle scars were too impressive to overlook. Knows when he's been bested, and knows when to be submissive. Aimed to keep himself in the position of friendly fellow male, uninterested in the Rut itself. Sat with The Red at the base of his Hill for hours while no judges or competitors were present. Watched over him as The Red slept.</p>

		<p>Did not follow when The Red left to join another, but did not move away either. Briefly took the time to dote upon The Red's lack of Pictogram glow, with some envy.</p>
	
		<p>In no time at all, was rejoined by The Red (alone) and repositioned himself to be politely closer to the hart. Then watched him cavort about with a fawn. Yes, stone's definitely just lazy. Worked on cairns at the base of the Hill instead&mdash;perhaps, somehow, they'd serve some advantage. Folks liked decoration, right?</p>

		<p>Was rejoined on and off by The Red and slept at his side for some time.</p>
	
		<p>Witnessed a newcomer who he did not immediately recognize. Only when he felt the pictogram did her realize it was Rune. Internally screamed. Many nuzzles and much gallivanting was had before they stood together for, like, a year, grooming and nuzzling and what have you. They talked, and it was feels.</p>
	
		<p>After a long while of talking, stone grew tired, and he slept.</p>

		<p>Came back.</p>
		<p>Awoke, in the Pond. Immediately scented the musk-laden air, clouded by testosterone and full of tension. There was no mistaking rut, no matter what the species.</p>
		<p>Admittedly eager to see how such a thing will play out in this place. More than anything, however, elated at the thought of seeing his loved ones again.</p>
		<p>Spent many uninterrupted hours building cairns in the Pond.</p>
		<p>Noticed while he was building that his antlers have grown. Obviously, being in The Dark Place does allow the passage of time, though he does not eat there. He thinks it's strange that his body would grow even without food, but it certainly does explain how fawns do so well here.</p>
		<p>Dozed off and awoke to Stria plopped almost atop him. Stood nearly aghast, bewildered by how much she'd grown. Time does fly when you're&hellip; Elsewhere. Nuzzled her something good and was generally a boring old guy around her.</p>
		<p>Eventually, allowed himself to settle back into the Dark Place, which he has become extremely familiar and comfortable with.</p>

		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for hardly a moment before deciding to go on a walk, hoping to meet friendly company if he went looking for it. Saw plenty of company, but none he felt comfortable approaching.</p>
		<p>Gathered some stones and set about building a cairn atop a stump near the Ruins, hoping merely being away from his typical spot might result in some interaction.</p>

		<p>Awoke, not feeling like sticking around long.</p>

			<p>Back from pseudo-Australia. Being connected is awesome.</p>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for but a moment, noticing immediately that he was no longer alone. Set out to find a familiar face right away, slightly under the pretense of “getting some exercise in.”</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, didn't “hear” anyone he knew. Continued on his trot anyway, set on finding something to do if there was no one he knew to visit. Besides, seeing some others&mdash;even those he didn't know&mdash;would be good for him. He <em>was</em> a herd animal, after all.</p>
		<p>Found another (Username Dauta), but lost some time (switched to OOC to help with set, since stone hates Magic so much he won't even touch it to help out) without being quite sure what happened. Found himself at one moment standing before the stranger, and in the next standing somewhere else alone. Returned to the Pond in a brow-furrowed daze to contemplate the event, though decided it was best left alone shortly after.</p>
		<p>Decided to get up and take that walk anyway, but did not get far when suddenly some new insight hit him. Actually had to sit down due to the force of the revelation; was so deeply moved that he became totally immobilized for some time.</p>
		<p>Had another odd lapse (OOC chillin' with Vala, hey guuuurl) and just started to accept them. Figured he must just be going senile.</p>
		<p>Eventually settled into the Dark Place.</p>

		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in Limbo. Lay in the Pond for a while. Itchy, got up to scratch on a nearby pine. Knocked his right antler on the trunk, and was surprised&mdash;as he is every year&mdash; when it fell off. Thinking to himself, he realized it <em>was</em> around that time. Turned to his other side to whop off the left antler, only to discover it was very much not ready.</p>
		<p>Frowning, he returned to his spot at the shore of the Pond, feeling very unbalanced. This would get annoying fast. It always did.</p>
		<p>In an effort to distract himself from his left-leaning predicament, stone wandered around, wondering when he wouldn't be alone. He wanted to see Rune and Stria, and it'd been so long since he'd seen H.. Still, he could deal with this for now. The quiet was nice, and if he was alone, there was no chance of danger too.</p>
		<p>He lay back down to rest again, drifting to the Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Blue Bowl. Slowly came to and noticed how very <em>quiet</em> it was. Made his way back to the Pond, realizing along the way a few odd things: firstly, he didn't hurt at all; secondly, his Glowing Name was gone; and thirdly—perhaps most importantly—he was completely, entirely, and utterly alone.</p>
		<p>This was odd.</p>
		<p>Listened for a while to be certain of it, due to just how strange it was. While listening, the Glowing Name sprouted back, as if it'd never left. Frowning at this, stone settled back down, having nothing special to do even with this interesting development.</p>
		<p>Sat and stacked tall cairns, unusually graceful in this somehow slightly different Forest. Did nothing else of interest but enjoy the sunlight, nature, and the ache being out of his joints.</p>

		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for a while. Caught the&hellip; Feeling of Rune's floating name. Immediately sprinting toward it, ignoring the protest from his joints at the sudden demand he put on them.</p>
		<p>Was astounded, delighted, by how the small thing&mdash;no longer so small&mdash;was growing. Felt... Proud. So proud, even though he'd had little to do with it. Absolutely swelled with affection while nuzzling and grooming Rune&mdash;who had mysterious berry-smell in his fur which was likely not so mysterious after all. <s>Stria pls.</s></p>
		<p>Stood beside him just grooming and watching him for some time, taking in all that had changed in his apparently lengthy absence. <s>Work <em>pls</em></s>.</p>
		<p>Not fully certain how, managed to doze off for a moment. Must be getting old, didn't even lie down on purpose. Happy to have awoken with Rune laying beside him. Comfortable enough to just stay there.</p>
		<p>Eventually got to his hooves after feeling Stria and led Rune to meet her at the Ruins. Watched them cavort about with one or two other young'uns before they settled in a pile, while he curled about. Comforted by having them so close-by, he soon after fell asleep, contentedly returning to the Dark Place.</p>

			<h3><time datetime="2014-05-11">May 11, 2014</time></h3>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Found himself an adult&mdash;with the Glowing Name still lingering over his head. In a way, knew this would happen. Knew this would be in his future as soon as he first saw them, not unlike how glimpsing the supernatural leaves one seeing ghosts, whether they want to or otherwise.</p>
		<p>Readily accepted it, not in the mood to angst about something he had no control over. Got to his hooves, sensing a great number of floating names about him, all across the Forest. One of them drew him near, familiar and yet one he'd not seen before (Lat'svel). Began making his way toward it; however, no matter how far he went, the name never grew bright&mdash;brighter, yes, but he never grew truly nearer. Perplexed by this, eventually gave up when he felt Stria. They approached one another somewhere in the First Forest.</p>
		<p>Stria then led him back to a very large group (10+) where a few young’uns (probably some of Shahla's children) and several adults dwelt (including La and Shahla). It seemed Stria wanted to introduce him to the group, or at least a few members, but stone wanted no part of it. With so many new faces, he was wary of members which might not be what they seemed, especially with H.'s daughter to look after. Despite the fact Stria had proved safe alone, even smelling of the milk of another female, his agitation did not abate. Stood somewhat nervously to the side, keeping his eyes on everyone, turning whenever someone ventured behind him.</p>
		<p>Soon after, his nervousness nearly doubled when his old eyes glanced over Shahla. Now there was a colour he remembered: back home, in India, tigers were a very rare thing. He had been young, suckling from his mother when his herd suddenly took fright, going from standing to a sprint as quickly as their legs could carry them. No one was caught, but he remembered those orange and black stripes slinking back into the trees. It was those same black and orange stripes he saw now, though they sat not upon the frame of a tiger. At least, not exactly. She was an ungulate, most definitely, but her colours screamed "tiger" an in her features too, traces of the big cat. He snorted with displeasure, pawing at the ground in nervousness.</p>
		<p>And of course, Stria flocked to her, thus proving who she'd nursed from in H.'s absence. Oh, what H. would think. He hoped she wouldn't turn to him for an explanation; he'd not be long if those tines turned against him.</p>
		<p>Stria tried very hard to lure stone in to meeting, but he was quite stubborn about it&mdash;tiger or otherwise, she was just strange enough that he in no way felt comfortable about her, or the rest of the group for that matter.</p>
		<p>Seeking to leave the group, he meandered farther and farther from the edge of them, trying to coax Stria into accompanying him. Though, at one point, he heard the gentle fall of hooves behind him. Turning, he was absolutely panicked to discover Shahla just behind him, sniffing at him. Spooked, he did his best to stay put, every fiber of his being telling him to get away. He shifted on his hooves until they sniffed at each other. Not scenting flesh or blood, he was reassured at least. Even if she did feed on kind such as he, it was not a frequent thing. Still, tiger.</p>
		<p>With a great deal of reluctance and sulking, Stria did eventually follow. He did not wander far from the group, but did settle out of view in the blueberry bushes near the Crying Idol, picking from them to calm his nerves, settling down in the foliage to feel secure. Stria settled away from him, but due to his stubbornness and concern he replaced himself around her, determined to see her safety through, threat or otherwise.</p>
		<p>They nibbled at the bushes and the grass, but did not leave there for some time. And eventually, he settled down, and went to the Dark Place.</p>

		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for a moment. Now appeared to be his fawn-self virtually all the time. Though not sure what to make of it exactly, he was now entirely certain that the Magic must be up to no good. Sensed it'd be over soon enough, but that the Glowing Names would be there to stay.</p>
		<p>Though that wasn't entirely a bad thing&mdash;despite their magical origin, he could use them to his advantage. Sensed H. and Stria far off in the Birch&mdash;well beyond the distance he could have scented H. from&mdash;and made his way to them immediately. Shocked H. with his adolescence, and delighted Stria with it. <a href="https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/69603661_Y5eaLUnh2UyhcTa.jpg">Ran around with her like a moron</a> while H. settled and aloofly observed their idiocy. Being a fawn certainly energized him, that was true.</p>
		<p>Settled not long afterward near H. while Stria clambered atop her. Lay there for some time, quietly enjoying the good company, until they all drifted off one-by-one to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go.</p>

		<p>Awoke, beneath the slanted stone of the Playground. Immediately hopped up onto one of the larger stones&mdash;setting himself up for a pulled ligament later&mdash;full of vigor. Sniffed the air, but didn't catch any familiar scents. Settled down on the rock for some time before getting up to venture back to the Pond.</p>
		<p>Was stopped in his tracks by the sight of giant, purple tulips. Promptly gave up and continued on his way.</p>
		<p>Settled on the bank for a time, shifting into his fawn-self with the Glowing Name just long enough to feel Stria somewhere in the Birch. Immediately got to his hooves and hurried over in an attempt to find her before he lost sight of the Names. Was successful (barely, shifting only moments before bumping into her), but sustained an injury from his efforts, much to his amusement.</p>
		<p>Settled with her for a bit before shifting again to his fawn-self. Played with her for some time&mdash;free from the pain his actual-age-form suffered&mdash;gallivanting about as she explored and he supervised. Witnessed her come across several things for the first time, including the giant tulips (which he nibbled and head butted at in their mutual curiosity; they tasted gross to him, but probably because he considered them to be associated with Magic more than their actual flavour), the butterflies and hyacinth flower patches, and the Pond&mdash;much to his delight. Splashed about with her and wallowed in some mud, generally making a mess of themselves.</p>
		<p>Eventually settled down and dazed for some time, leaving to the Dark Place after Stria did so, returning much later (all the while still in his fawn-form, which was becoming increasingly frequent) with her eventually rejoining him. Continued playing with her for a bit ("guarding" her briefly against a curious "intruder" (user hts1128) and other most-likely-innocent bystanders), briefly returning to his typical shape for a few moments which he used to begin grooming her. Though the notion of grooming with his mouth did not used to faze him, he now had certain doubts about it, as some things tasted gross. However, she was very messy, and the mud may have started to give her an odour if he didn't do something about it. Continued grooming her through his return to fawn-form, eventually settling beside her in the water.</p>
		<p>Eventually nuzzled into her side and ventured to the Dark Place.</p>

		<p>While still in the Dark Place/Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go, heard-felt-sensed rain amidst the nothing-something blackness. Willed himself awake to find, indeed, it was raining. Delighted at the recent changes in weather reminiscent of home.</p>
		<p>Sensed Stria near the Blue Bowl, though could not sense her Glowing Name. Figured he was probably getting more connected to the Forest and its Magic, and while this upset him, at least he could find those he knew even when the rain dampened the earth and hid their scents&mdash;not that she had one of her own yet to find anyway.</p>
		<p>Settled with her, noticing that her head was on fire with some alarm before realizing it was some of those <s>dagnab new-agey</s> Magic candles. Frowned to himself but did not remark upon it. He'd see what her mother had to say about it. It's not like Stria understood such things yet anyway. To her, it must have just been warm and bright, and there was nothing wrong with those two things alone. Still, the flickering lights reminded him of the Glowing Names.</p>
		<p>Happily found himself in the company of not only Stria but Rune shortly afterward, though his visit was unfortunately brief. Still, it was for the best, as he wasn't being particularly interesting, especially to young fawns&mdash;on the contrary, the longer he stood in the rain, the more mesmerized he became with it, getting up to stand in it for a long time, feeling it trickle through his fur and run down his legs.</p>
		<p>Just as he settled down again beside Stria, he found himself as a fawn. Again. This time it was becoming old, and he merely sighed, not even bothering to get back to his feet, eying the Glowing Name with disapproval. At least it looked alright. Wrong as it was.</p>
		<p>Noticed Stria shift uncomfortably due to his change, despite having seen it happen before. Knew the feeling. Tried not to let it ruin his good mood brought on by the rain, with success.</p>
		<p>Shifted between the two states&mdash;Glowing Nameless adult and Glowing Named fawn&mdash;a few times before it settled, finally, on the smaller of the two. Found himself chilled far easier this way, and so huddled closer to Stria for warmth, feeling a kinship with the fawns from sharing their stature. Knew eventually, one way or the other, he'd work it out. Didn't worry about it after that.</p>
		<p>Found himself growing drowsy, almost hypnotized by the rain. Led Stria to the Playground beneath the slanted stone so she wouldn't freeze to death when he left. Despite sharing the area with four others, they seemed safe enough, and all asleep too.</p>
		<p>Correct in his precaution, went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go almost immediately after.</p>

		<p> Awoke, to twilight. Was actually confused at first, then delighted. Lively due to the crepuscular weather, he immediately got up to wander, even going so far as to play a bit, jumping over the stream a few times until he got sore and laid down. </p>
		<p> Still a bit longing for some socialization, hoping to bump into someone he knows or to make a new friend. Or three. That aside, didn't make any special effort to socialize. They just seemed strange. </p>
		<p> Wandered around some, no goal in mind but not ready to settle back down. </p>
		<p> Eventually made his way back to the Pond after he'd tired himself out. Met an&hellip; Interesting young stag (Kintsukuroi, 'Tsu'). Watched him with guarded interest&mdash;guarded because something was very clearly wrong with the stag, interest because he was so unusual about it, and didn't come off as malicious per say. Watched him apparently gargle for a good period of time at the dragonflies, and go through a number of other peculiar behaviours. Felt mildly uncomfortable around Tsu, but not enough to dissuade him from at least watching. Plus, company was better than none, mentally deficient or otherwise. </p>
		<p> Moved to the other side of the Pond when another undead being reared its head, intending to wait it out. Scented the air only to find it had severely worsened. A foul black being was in the Pond, almost in his spot. Moved closer to better observe him, though not so close as to draw his attention. Waited him out, then moved to his typical spot at the Pond's shore to assess the damage, happy to discover that not much was left to display the being's passing. Settled again. </p>
		<p> After some time of virtually no activity, went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go. </p>
		-
		<p> Awoke. Lay in the Pond for but a moment before getting to his hooves to forage. Was almost overcome with hunger and browsed at blueberries, ferns, hyacinths, watercress, and cattails. His wandering, however, was not entirely for food: hopped across the stream a few times more, later bumping into some fireflies. Having never experienced fireflies, set about some horseplay of his own beneath them, riling them up a bit to see what would happen. (All of this silliness was, unknowingly, perpetrated in front of Lats'vel, whose opinion is still of value.) </p>
		<p> Eventually returned to the Pond to drink and rest, warily eyeing a deer (user Lisa567) which appeared to be laying on the surface of the Pond before deciding to just ignore it unless it became a problem. </p>
		<p>	Had a good rest on the shoreline after being so boisterous. Eventually drifted off Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go. </p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Hidden away in a blueberry bush—like a fawn—he woke up feeling secure and comforted, despite being in a place he'd never fully felt at home. Returned to the Pond only to be joined by Rune, who was growing nicely.</p>
		<p>Abruptly found himself in the Dark Place. Had enough mind to him to try to explore, though was apparently without a body to do so with. Had the vague sense of being without the knowledge of it. Despite the ethereal nature of the Dark Place, it felt natural, not like Forest Magic. For that reason, didn't entirely mind. Took the chance to simply relax without having to worry about predation or Magic or anything else. Time moves strangely there—felt like a very long time, but also not long at all.</p>
		<p>Awoke in the Pond, where he'd left Rune. Obviously some time had passed, despite what the sun implied. It wasn't trustworthy there anyway. Found himself a fawn again, with the Glowing Name. This time, sat through it, waiting for it to wear off like before. Despite the fact that he enjoyed being young again, he couldn't really enjoy it knowing he detested its source. Began to consider that the Forest Magic might be doing this all intentionally, as if in an effort to "convert" him to embracing it. Was troubled by these thoughts, though didn't decide one way or the other.</p>
		<p>Sat and watched a large group of fawns and a few adults be generally boisterous, casting spells and whatnot. Felt an odd desire to join them—not out of the necessity of a herd, but merely out of a want to be with others, actively interacting. Abstained perhaps only because their frolic was so rooted in Magic. Watched with a sense of longing.</p>
		<p>Finally returned to his adult state sometime later. Became so apathetic to it all that he promptly fell asleep, happy to return to the Dark Place/Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go.</p>

		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for a while. Wallowed, and shortly afterward was filled with the desire to roam around.</p>
		<p>Quite suddenly, found himself as a fawn. With a glowing thing floating above him. Thought the glowing thing looked like two stacked stones sitting on the ground. Tried to shake it off, but it floated there yet. Found himself seeing one of these glowing things on every being he passed, deer or otherwise. Noticed they were all different, like names in a way. Didn't like it one bit, but was more preoccupied with the fact he was suddenly young again.</p>
		<p>Stumbled over to the Playground only to find Stria and Rune—who he now virtually met the eyes of. Noticed they had the Glowing Names too, and that he could... Feel the Glowing Names all across the forest. Knew that he'd be able to feel theirs too, if he could see them. Knew it was the Magic. Grew bitter with the Forest, but not entirely; enjoyed being able to jump onto and down from the big stones, to run, enjoyed being without pain.</p>
		<p>Returned to his usual age off of the stones. Was simultaneously reassured and the slightest bit sad. Nuzzled at Stria and Rune while they twined around him in play and affection. Settled back into his old bones, grazing the grasses while he considered the events. Realized slowly that he could no longer see or feel the Glowing Names. Could not be reassured by that—knew they were there, somehow.</p>
		<p>Saw H. coming toward the three of them and was immediately reassured. At least with her it all felt so much more manageable. Groomed her while she nursed Stria and Rune.</p>
		<p>Tried to follow them up a short rock but found it too high for him to do comfortably—even though he had jumped it not long before as a youth—eventually working himself around the rock until he found a low point to climb. Joined them sitting on a corner of the rock's sun-warmed surface, allowing Stria to nibble his ear, shaking whenever her nibbling turned to biting. Silly fawn. Found it endearing.</p>
		<p>Suddenly was not-there, in a dark place. Wasn't frightened, or even upset. Felt almost like being asleep, the gentleness of a dream, drifting in the black. Came back to the Forest, where he'd been sitting, now just him and Stria. Considered that this might have been Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go, though was worried about the implications of recent events. Becoming a fawn? Glowing Names? Going to the Dark Place, even while awake? The Forest Magic was to blame, he was certain. The events troubled him.</p>
		<p>Found comfort in Stria's odd acts, naïve affection. Something innocent, familiar, untainted by the Magic—that was just what he needed. Sat with her for a long, long time.</p>

			<p>Returned to the Pond to wallow <time datetime="2014-04-05">April 5th</time>; fell asleep there.</p>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for a while. Knows he has been more absent than usual from the Forest, and also knows that H. has been away for some time too. Obviously, cannot detect if the fawns have been around recently, as they leave no scent to trace. Still, has a certain feeling that everyone's been Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go quite a bit recently.</p>
		<p>Despite missing a herd, and distantly missing those individuals in particular, he's not worried for any of them—<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">except Khuna, who he's come to believe is either dead, or was hidden in a very secluded spot by H. due to her weakness and vulnerability, both to protect her and the other fawns who would be alarmingly easy to find with their light-furred sibling hiding near them.</span></p>
		<p>Found himself in the company of a fawn (user Razzberry) and, later, an adult (user Purplemoon)—acknowledged both with his typical stare-greeting, though found himself alienated by their behaviours and ultimately elected to largely ignore them, enjoying their presence for what it was. They left shortly after the adult arrived.</p>
		<p>Noted that the Forest was quiet while he set about gathering stones to build a cairn at the water's edge, passing the time and resting his old bones.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Contemplated the fate of Khuna while he rested.</span> Noted that when he was Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go, he did not come to need food or water, nor did he find himself any cleaner or more sullied upon returning from wherever it was he went, even if he was gone from the Forest for some time. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Deduced that for Khuna, it must be the same way, lest she would have starved to death long ago. Considered that she may be alive after all and just spending her time Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go; however, also understood that since he does not find himself changed when he goes and returns, she might not either, thus making her even more of a runt than before. In the end, did not decide on anything, given the fact that he had no idea how his place worked for him, let alone for anyone else. Maybe it was different for everyone. Maybe she'd be fine.</span></p>
		<p>Done with thought for the time being, set about the rather extravagant task of creating two cairns which would balance a third cairn between them, the third of which would not contact the ground. Became very absorbed in his work, virtually losing awareness of his surroundings entirely.</p>
		<p>Was joined by 0 and moved to accommodate the being—easy, since it was merely a crow (or a raven—he didn't ask). Continued his work in, essentially, silent concentration.</p>
		<p>Not before long, found Lats'vel was virtually right on top of him. Got to his feet to greet the boar-beast—large boar-beast—and exchanged snuffles with him. Witnessed 0 transform into a deer for the first time to react to Lats'vel accordingly. Snuffles were had. Shortly afterward, Lats'vel virtually disappeared to do boar things. 0 became a bird again, and the two moved to a different portion of the Pond's edge. Tinkered with pebbles and watched the dragonflies.</p>
		<p>Noticed 0 had gone some time while he was distracted by the dragonflies. Lay down his head while he continued watching them. Debated going to the Blue Bowl to check if anyone he knew was there, but decided against it since H. would have come to him if she was around (far better nose than he, he'd learned) and there was nothing he could do for the fawns but make their presence more obvious.</p>
		<p>Eventually settled and went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Somewhat misses the Pond, but is loathe to leave H. and her fawns. Found Stria in the Blue Bowl near where he'd awoken, well-hidden and asleep. Scented Rune and went to check on him, almost passing him entirely before hearing a squeak from some shrubbery at the base of a tree. Settled near him, reluctant to choose between him and Stria, but intending to move him closer to Stria after he rested a moment. Conveniently, Stria came to join them shortly afterward, most likely having scented him, seeking food. In fact, they were both hungry. Found himself taking care of the two of them the best he could while they all waited for H..</p>
		<p>Drifted off in thought, really contemplating the nature of his attachment. Back home, he'd grow antlers, fight for does, accrue a harem which he defended, mate, and&hellip; That was it. But back then, he didn't know. He didn't realize. He knew the consequences of his actions, and it was not that he didn't care. So, he wondered, why did he care so much now? Because he knew not only what he knew before, but a wealth of other things? It was true, he held contempt for the Magic which was most likely responsible for taking him from his home with no apparent chance of return, and definitely responsible for implanting within his mind a plethora of things he never could have known naturally; but that aside, now that the deed was done, now that he knew what he knew&hellip; He found himself enjoying it, in a way. He liked knowing some things. He liked caring, beyond just what he cared for previously, beyond feeding, surviving, victory, gathering a harem, mating. He liked&hellip; The awareness. Not entirely, and he still scorned new knowledge away. But he was grateful for friends, beyond merely for the fact that they were company. He was happy to see the beings he knew, the beings he loved. H., Rune, Stria, Khuna&mdash;they were his herd&hellip; His family. He was reluctant to admit it, to embrace it, but he knew what a family was now, knew what it meant. They were the closest thing to a family he'd ever known, and despite the fact that he never would have experienced one at home, it didn't feel "unnatural." It didn't feel wrong. It felt right.</p>
		<p>He felt right.</p>
		<p>Sat for a long time today, reflecting on his life before, on his memories. Realized so many things that he hadn't understood, came into awareness of so many details about the life he'd had before. Still missed home, will always miss home, but found himself just a bit more at peace with it all.</p>
		<p>Hardly noticed when Stria and Rune came and went to nurse from H. in the Blue Bowl. Kept them warm and safe when they sat with him, thinking idly to himself, balancing stones, generally happy with everything.</p>
		<p>Sat with Stria for a long time; tried to teach her how to balance stones, how to say her mother's "name" (though he knew it was far too early) and told her some things he'd learned over his life. Knew she would not understand, but enjoyed himself anyway.</p>
		<p>Eventually, with some reluctance, settled into rest, after convincing himself that Stria would be safe in the foliage. Went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go.</p>

		<p>Awoke, in the Birch. Lay with H. and Stria for a long while, keeping tabs on them and just watching for some time, balancing rocks when watching wasn't enough to occupy his mind.</p>
		<p>Coped with more than one being who elected to come by his herd and harass its members with spells, sounds, and ruckus. Quietly became rather fed up with the nonsense, though kept his own.</p>
		<p>After H. moved Stria for a third time&mdash;ending up in the Blue Bowl&mdash;two fawns elected to continue the behaviour his herd had been putting up with for a long while. Finally decided enough was enough and stood with H. to put on a display to frighten them off, lest their horseplay draw attention to the newborn, resulting in her death. Did so mostly out of the desire to protect Stria, but also for the sake of the intrusive fawns. H.'s temper was far shorter than his even without young to protect, and he recognized she was a bigger threat to them than their young minds seemed to realize.</p>
		<p>After the fawns did not show signs of returning, went to stand over the Stria and her mother (as best as he could, given H.'s stature in comparison to his own).</p>
		<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">Wondered to himself if Khuna was alive. He'd not seen the fawn for some time, and without milk and protection, such a frail thing would not survive long.</p>
		<p>Eventually gave into the temptation and grazed on blueberries nearby while contemplating recent events.</p>
		<p>Without further incident, eventually settled into sleep, departing to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go.</p>

			<h3><time datetime="2014-03-31">March 31, 2014</time></h3>
			<p>Stria and Khuna were born. Rune was adopted.</p>
		</header>
		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for a while. Idly wondered about H., as he hadn't seen her in some time. Wondered if she'd had her fawn(s) yet. Staying alert to, hopefully, identify her scent if she comes around.</p>
		<p>Wondered about Rune. Hoped he was alright, alive. Worried about him.</p>
		<p>Got up to graze and bathe to put his strained mind at ease. Thinking could be so tiresome.</p>
		<p>Had returned to the shore of the Pond and, apparently, nodded off when he was awoken by a gentle touch to his neck. Turning to face it, he noticed H., in labour of all things, making her way to the Birch Forest to give birth in the more secluded area. Followed immediately.</p>
		<p>Stood watch in case of predators, until he was asked to invite Lats'vel closer by the hind. Attempted to do so several times, though was unsure about how to invite anyone anywhere. Ended up just walking laps around the boar in what he hoped seemed like an inviting and inclusive manner, though most likely confused him more than anything. Tried not to come off as aggressive, at least.</p>
		<p>Was rather confused by the event himself, as he'd never even witnessed a birth, let alone participated. Despite that, did his best to be certain that she and her offspring were safe. Though her first&mdash;Khuna&mdash;was simple enough, she did not seem done. Deduced there were two fawns&hellip; As her size implied. Waited for the second while juggling trying to keep her and the fawns safe, her friends calm, and everything friendly.</p>
		<p>Was surprised by how many beings came to witness the birth. Back home, this was an ordinary thing for the season. Remembered though, this place was very little, if hardly at all, like home.</p>
		<p>Noticed Rune on the sideline; wanted to invite the fawn closer, but realized H. might object to the notion of another fawn being so close to her newborn, soon to be newborns. Reluctantly left things as they were.</p>
		<p>Shortly thereafter, the second fawn&mdash;Stria&mdash;was born without further complications.</p>
		<p>H. settled to rest and nurse her fawns. Stone, still somewhat at a loss, invited Rune to sit with him near the group, though not so near as to aggravate the already exhausted mother. Watched over everyone to the best of his ability.</p>
		<p>Found himself exhausted by the ordeal.</p>
		<p>Was pleased to see the second fawn was apparently healthy and the proper size, given H.'s impressive stature; <del>wondered, however, about the first fawn. That colour did not live long where he came from, and it was so small, so thin. Wondered to himself how such a large, strong, experienced mother birthed such a frail little white fawn, though decided it must have been the Magic of this Forest making a pest of itself. Knew that if any mother would see such a fawn through its vulnerable stages, it would be H..</del> [Khuna was adopted by Kimi July 24th and modified. This is no longer accurate and has been redacted, though left in-tact for record's sake.]</p>
		<p>Again, continued to watch over what was starting to become a rather large group, especially while H. settled into bouts of sleep. Knew she must be tired.</p>
		<p>Managed to slide Rune closer after noticing he was spooking at just about everything. Briefly explained to H., through both speech and the obviousness of the situation, what he knew about the fawn. Took H.'s side, her fawns and Rune between them, while she nursed her young. Attempted to make it clear to Rune that he was welcome to join them in nursing, but wasn't worried about it considering the fawn's relative wellness even without apparent help. Was relieved to know that, at least for now, everyone was safe and happy.</p>
		<p>Helped to herd the fawns away from a few circling predators, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">noticing as Khuna fell behind. Was certain that Stria and Rune were settled in the tall grass before he went to stand guard over the runt, not faulting it for its weakness. Returned to encircle the fawns with H. after Khuna joined them in the grass.</span></p>
		<p>Was joined by another fawn, noting H.'s patience had worn thin for newcomers, especially more fawns. Well aware that she had more than enough to deal with already. Still, was too tired&mdash;and, admittedly, kind&mdash;to chase it off. Kept himself between it and the pile that was H. and her fawns, Rune now included.</p>
		<p>Found himself in a daze and, when his wits returned, Rune was gone. Was concerned at first, but realized the young thing had gotten this far without issue. Settled again with H., her fawns between them.</p>
		<p>Briefly followed H. when she stood to invite Lats'vel over, guarding her fawns. Alas, the boar would not join them or even sniff the fawns. Failed to understand the deeper implications of the situation&mdash;in all honesty, was not interested beyond the welfare of H. and the newborns.</p>
		<p>Accidentally bumped Stria when she tried to nurse from him; gave her a puzzled look before, amused, he settled back down with them. The crowd having virtually entirely dispersed by this point, he allowed his guard to lower a bit, even lying his head down beside the fawns to rest&mdash;but not to sleep. Not yet. Only allowed the tired mother that luxury.</p>
		<p>In and out of dazes, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">noticed that Khuna had gone to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go as well,</span> and that Stria was very much asleep. Relieved that they had all made it through their first day safely.</p>
		<p>Seeing H. looking so confident, felt alright with allowing himself to sleep, for a while.</p>
		<p>Finally, after a very long day, and having had nothing occur for long enough to assure him that H. and her remaining fawn would be alright alone, went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go.</p>

		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for a while. Came and went from Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go a few times without much incident.</p>
		<p>Wasn't hungry or thirsty, though he knew he ought to be. Made cairns out of river stones.</p>
		<p>Joined by a small thing (Rune). Didn't pay him too much mind, though didn't mind the company either.</p>
		<p>Was spelled by what was probably a stag; the usual routine ensued. Was followed immediately by the fawn who'd taken his side. Proceeded to graze the Pond vegetation with him, growing fonder of him as time passed, even staying somewhat close to him when the Pond became busy. Eventually collected a few stones and settled back down to build another cairn, with the fawn again taking his side.</p>
		<p>Especially enjoys his company, despite the fact it's not his usual sort of herd. He's had very little experience with fawns, especially such <em>new</em> fawns.</p>
		<p>Came to realize that if the fawn had a mother, she was a very lax one. In the past, he wouldn't have considered caring for a fawn, had nothing to do with it. Now, however, he found his intellect driving him to do otherwise. The fawn was obviously capable, seemed healthy, didn't rashly run about drawing attention to itself with loud sounds and frivolous activity. By all means, if he was going to find himself caring for anything, this was the type of fawn he'd have wanted.</p>
		<p>For now, has elected to care for the fawn (Rune) however he can; though, he knows, he's no substitute for a good mother. With H.'s fawns so near to birthing, he understands he's going to be around babies for a long time anyway.</p>
		<p>Stood when two rambunctious stags came cavorting about, causing all kinds of ruckus. The fawn immediately hurried under him, apparently upset by the two, though stone hardly paid it mind. He did, however, keep careful watch on the stags to be certain that their loud and energetic display didn't prove harmful to any of the deer around, particularly the one tucked beneath him.</p>
		<p>Settled back down again once their horseplay took them elsewhere, the fawn again settling at his side. Noticing that he'd taken interest in the rock balancing, attempted to demonstrate in more detail what he was doing, setting aside a few smaller stones in case the fawn wished to try for himself. Bumbled along explaining what it was he was doing and why, though mostly mumbling to himself rather than expecting the young being to actually understand him. Wasn't even certain if the fawn had the capacity to learn language at all.</p>
		<p>Was a bit sad to, eventually, see the young thing leave to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go, but was also relaxed to be lifted of the self-imposed duty. Allowed himself to drift between alertness and spell-giving dazes, before eventually succumbing to sleep himself.</p>

		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for a while. Noticed a deer come by, pick up a pelt enchantment, and use it on the deer it'd picked up the spell from. Sighed in anticipation of what he knew was coming.</p>
		<p>Was spelled. Entered the Pond deeper to remove it. Sat in the deep water for a while, hoping that would get the message across.</p>
		<p>Returned to the shore; watched some deer linger around the resting one, idly wondering what they were doing without particularly minding one way or another.</p>
		<p>Went to wash and received a mask enchantment from the Pond itself (it was actually a fawn, hiding as a frog, in the water). Stood for a moment, washed it off, then wandered away in bewilderment. Settled again at the Pond's edge, trying to understand what occurred.</p>
		<p>Decided to leave the water for a little while and gorge himself on blueberries in the Blue Bowl, in hopes that the Pond/water will not do that again when he returns. Avoided North on the way out of a sense of unease toward the being.</p>
		<p>Again, ate himself bloated (though this time, less uncomfortably), and wound up resting there for some time.</p>
		<p>Encountered a small, human-faced, albino roe who immediately shied away from him and went back to a small, grayish thing which emitted light and a clicking noise. Wanted nothing to do with the strangeness of it after having been cast on by a body of water.</p>
		<p>Fell into a spell-giving daze amidst the blueberries.</p>
		<p>Came to suddenly from a dream he couldn't recall, unsure of where he was. Got to his feet in a panic before remembering and calming down, though not entirely.</p>
		<p>While again avoiding North, returned to the Pond, though got a bit lost on the way. Fell into a spell-giving daze again once on its banks.</p>
		<p>Went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go shortly thereafter.</p>

		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for a while. Bathed while entertaining the idea of food, but dismissed it to sun himself on the shore of the pond, for once looking to dry off. Was spooked by the chim&aelig;ra known as North and moved to keep his distance partially hidden in a willow tree. Not usually so flighty, but had believed the animal to be a stag until seeing its face, and became more startled than he otherwise would have been at that sudden surprise.</p>
		<p>Moved back to the water's edge to stack stones.</p>
		<p>Met the ever charming Greitai.</p>
		<p>They did not hit it off.</p>
		<p>Though she was just having a sniff at him, he smelled death on her and wanted no part of it. Not to mention the fact she just doesn't look right.</p>
		<p>Shortly after Greitai gave up, H. came to join him, immediately sensing his distress and taking up a defensive, watchful stance. Not "above" being defended by a hind&mdash;after all, she's a force to be reckoned with. Recovering from the bout in his own way: by stacking stones and resting.</p>
		<p>Settled near H.'s side when she eventually settled down, still watchful, especially considering her pregnancy.</p>
		<p>Finally allowed himself to slip off to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go after a long wait with no sign of Greitai returning.</p>

		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for a while. Got up to eat and drink when the whim struck him to go searching for stones in the far reaches of the Forest. Witnessed a very large rabbit and heard the Old Oak's hum for the first time&mdash;was hesitant about both things. Totally passed H. without noticing her.</p>
		<p>Stumbled onto the Blue Bowl for the first time and gorged himself on blueberries, to the extent that he needed to lie down for a while. Did.</p>
		<p>Was joined by a, yet again, distressed H. who had just been attacked by someone after trying to reconcile with Lats'vel. Yet again did his best to calm her, both for her sake and the fawns, and sat with her in the Blue Bowl well into the day. Returned to the Pond after she left to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go.</p>

		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for a while. Wasn't hungry or thirsty, despite having gone some time without food or water. The many wonders of growing old.</p>
		<p>Instead, sat at the Pond's edge, watching some deer nearby, head down as if still in sleep. Was brought back fully to alertness by a fawn which elected to cast a pelt enchantment on him. Wouldn't have bothered to get up, but saw the fawn settling back down to gather another spell and quickly got to his hooves, eager to avoid more Magic. Gave the fawn a stare-greeting, not blaming it for the spell. Realized long ago that most members of the Forest <em>enjoy</em> the Magic.</p>
		<p>Went to wash in the Pond, aware of its cleansing effects. Was followed by the fawn, which seemed baffled at his cleaning techniques. Attempted to demonstrate when another fawn came upon him and cast yet another pelt spell. Cleansed that Magic off as well.</p>
		<p>Returned to his spot, pelt alteration corrected. Fell again into a spell-giving daze.</p>
		<p>Was again brought into alertness by a doe&mdash;Vala&mdash;casting yet another spell, this time giving him new antlers. Was not pleased, but again, was understanding. Stare-greeted her before dunking his face beneath the water, ridding himself of the enchantment.</p>
		<p>Settled again in his spot, falling into a spell-giving daze while watching the crowd. Yet again brought to alertness by a pelt spell from Vala. Somewhat frustratedly dragged himself to the deep water, cleansed himself of the enchantment, and stayed there, hoping the water might keep the Magic away.</p>
		<p>Began to tire and dragged himself back to shore, falling into a spell-giving daze for a long while, and eventually drifting off to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go.</p>

		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for a while.</p>
		<p>Got up to graze when a stranger&mdash;Barwick&mdash;came by. Gave the usual stare-greeting before grazing with him. Was reassured by the herd, small as it was, and enjoyed his company. Allowed his own mind to wander just enough to come into awareness of the name and the nature of his new friend. Was gently pleased.</p>
		<p>Lay beside Barwick for a while, until he went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go. Followed him shortly thereafter.</p>

		<p>Awoke. Lay in the Pond for a while. Got up to graze and wallow&mdash;glanced at the stones at the shore of the pond, but wasn't interested.</p>
		<p>Found himself in the company of a distressed H., smelling slightly of something rotten. Came into the awareness of the fact that she had earlier been trying to socialize with a small herd while also attempting to avoid an undead stag, the likes of which she also preferred to keep a great distance from, for similar reasons as he.</p>
		<p>Did what he could to calm and reassure her by grooming and asserting himself between her and anyone who came by for a short while. Eventually settled back down&mdash;though not without keeping an eye on her&mdash;when an acquaintance of hers came by who she went to sit with.</p>
		<p>Stayed alert until she went Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go, before settling into sleep himself.</p>

		<p>Learned to stack stones to distract himself from the knowledge granted by Forest Magic. Adopted the practice of wallowing in mud/”bathing” as a way to pass the time. Discovered he is not as hungry or thirsty here, and that the days are far, far too long. Learned to ignore the cycle of day/night, and to follow his own cycle for eating, drinking, sleeping, and migrating.</p>
		<p>Came to accept the fact he'll likely never be able to return home, though is not happy with it.</p>
		<p>Met some folks, though didn't learn any names. Distantly fond of a few denizens already.</p>

		<p>Awoke. Found himself in the Forest. Though at first not concerned, began to grow more and more dismayed. Experienced bouts of panic; went through the cycle of grief in full.</p>
		<p>Learned things: that the denizens of the Forest can be like those he knows, but are more often strange creatures; that this place loops on itself endlessly, and he cannot find his homeland amongst the trees; that there is Magic, and it feels unnatural to him; that there are dangers which lurk here still; and most importantly, that he can think, and know, and speak. Still struggles with his new-found intellect, as he always will.</p>
		<p>Found the Pond and settled in its waters; comforted by this respite which reminds him of the marsh he knows as home. Fell asleep feeling homesick, and went to Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go.</p>
