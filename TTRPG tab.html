WIP but making public to see if it helps motivate me to look more into this. If things don't make sense, it's because I've never played a TTRPG, and wrote this on the assumption of how such a thing might work with what I know about stone. I do think it will be helpful when comparing his ability as compared to others in the future inside and outside of any potential TTRPG settings.<br><br>

           A nameless sangai stag capable of speech and reason.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
           <i>Old.</i> Given to long, frequent periods of rest partially due to age, mostly due to lethargy.<br>
           <i>Wild.</i> Largely a feral animal. Behaves primarily according to biological needs and desires.<br>
           <i>Proud.</i> Strives to be respected and regarded as reliable. Confident and easily offended when dismissed.<br>
           <i>Voiced.</i> Speaks aloud to communicate, as a human would; has modified anatomy to do this, caused by Magic.<br>
           <i>Casual.</i> Acknowledges others by looking at them with no reaction, then returning to what he was doing—this is a means of displaying approval.<br>
           <i>Natural.</i> Equally capable of feral communication, however is limited by species, being more accurate with those of closer taxonomic relation.<br>
           <i>Reserved.</i> Does not use some common communicative gestures, considering them "unnatural"; others are performed with an unusual curtness.<br>
           <i>Enduring.</i> No longer physically ages since departing his homeland; all bodily characteristics are unknowingly governed by his belief.<br>
           <i>Purposed.</i> Driven to be the protector and provider he feels stags live to be. Views himself as the expendable protector of his herd, if necessary.<br>
           <i>Nostalgic.</i> Often found around bodies of water or in dense forest—they remind him of home.<br>
           <i>Perceptive.</i> Capable of understanding virtually anything via Magic; copes with the constant influx of unwanted knowledge by rock balancing.<br>
           <i>Prejudiced.</i> Hates having anything to do with Magic, anything he considers unnatural, and any being he considers to be a threat.<br>
           <i>Mistrustful.</i> Tends to avoid areas he associates with Magic, the unnatural, and predation. Any negative experiences are remembered, and heeded.<br>
           <i>Companionable.</i> Considers others around him to be herd-company, even at a distance. Often reliant upon socialization and camaraderie.

             His Herd—a surprisingly ever-shifting catalogue of individuals with whom he has built and lost relationships over the years. While some have lingered within it for over a decade, others are transient visitors, and almost all of his relationships are dependent on whim and coincidence. Despite the shifting nature of those he holds dear, his dedication toward its concept is resilient, a permanent place in his heart.

             He is deeply mistrustful of Magic and those who wield it, including those who he considers closest to him. Anything other than the "natural" repulses him, wide and far-ranging including even the most benevolent of healing, shape-shifting, and realm-hopping. His lack of awareness saves him from many difficult questions he would have to ask of himself—but for how long?

                 Rutting: +? Strength, -? ??<br>
                 In preparation for his rut, stone's neck muscles begin to visibly strengthen as soon as his velvet is shed in early January, are at their peak size around early March, and return to normal size by mid-April. His rut is from early February through the end of April, with the peak fighting occurring between late February and early March. When stone's rut comes about or others around him are in rut, he goes from being docile and unassuming to audacious and uninhibited. While not a stupid being, he's more likely to make rash decisions when his testosterone levels are elevated. Along with his rut comes an amplified sense of his responsibility to fill his role as the "patriarch" of a herd. He is the guardian, the provider; he must always be steadfast and reliable, to help and protect those for whom he deems himself responsible. From his perspective, it is his legacy to devote himself to a cause bigger than himself: the safety and comfort of others, and the continuation of his herd.

               <p>
                 Peak Rut: +?? Strength, -?? ??<br>
                 From late February through late March, stone is at his physical prime, and he knows it. His muscles are amped up on testosterone, and so is his mind. In this state he is impatient, intolerant, and potentially volatile. He's significantly less socially inhibited, and will either be strongly attractive or strongly repulsive depending on his own inclinations and that of those who regard him. Though he never truly loses himself to his hormones, this is when he is most likely to make errors in judgement and act before thinking things through. However, it is also when he is at his strongest, so this tends to balance out alright for him.

                 Basal State: +/- 0 Attributes<br>
                 Without the influence of excess testosterone, stone is still a proud animal, but tends to act cautiously. He does not seek out trouble or take risks except in circumstances where the reward far outweighs it

                 Hard Antlers: +"Antlers" Ability<br>
                 Having grown his antlers from late August through late December, he sheds his velvet around early January. In contrast, when his antlers are grown, he tends to be quite confident in himself, but not brash or overzealous. His confidence is felt as a certain self-possession, and he is as close to objective in his analysis of whether it is wise to fight, flee, or freeze as he can be in this physiological state. This state of mind is the closest to his most base personality of all those governed by his hormones.

                 Cast Antlers: +/- 0 Abilities/Attributes<br>
                 While his antlers may be cast anywhere between the beginning of July through the beginning of September, they are typically cast near the beginning of August. Being a feral creature, his personality is greatly altered by his hormones and physiological state. He is at his most vulnerable when he is without solid antlers. He is prone to wary behaviour around others across these periods, but has calmed down significantly as he's gone on living away from his homeland. He finds safety when in the presence of those he trusts, and will stand up for himself or others in proper company. When alone, he wanders about seeking trustworthy company, avoiding or fleeing from that which threatens him. Rarely though does he truly fear anything now that he has grown accustomed to strangeness.

                 After a couple of weeks of healing at the pedicle, a new pair of antlers then begin to grow within the same month. Being a feral creature, his personality is greatly altered by his hormones and physiological state. He is at his most vulnerable when he is without solid antlers.

               <p>
                 Winter Coat: +Cold Resistance<br>
                 While his fur is much denser during cooler months, the fur on his neck is particularly thick and coarse as well as darker overall, lending to the appearance of a mane. His colours are darker and desaturated, and somewhat inconsistently patchy across his body.

               <p>
                 Summer Coat: +Heat Resistance<br>
                 His fur is much thinner and less insulative during the warmer months, with an overall colouration somewhat more uniform reddish-orange across his body, and the distinct presence of fawn-like pale spots on his flank and lower back.

               <p>
                 Moulting Coat: +"Itchy" Debuff, -? ??<br>
                 He begins to moult his Winter coat around the end of April in mid-Spring, and is fully moulted into his Summer coat around the beginning of June in late Spring. The process is very obvious, with patches of thick fur coming out in clumps, and a noticeably scruffy appearance across May. His Winter coat begins to show through around mid-September in early Autumn, and is fully developed by the beginning of November in mid-Autumn. The process gradually grows more noticeable, with the change being incremental and not a dramatic shift. Across both processes, though particularly when moulting his Winter coat, he is slightly more distractable due to the itching. In addition, he leaves more traces of his presence wherever he goes in the form of shed hair.

                 Since departing his homeland, the stone balancer has been continually beseiged by "The Knowledge"—a ceaseless influx of various facts and tidbits of information entering his mind. While typically he does his best to occupy himself to quiet the thoughts, he has occasionally probed the Magic behind them for specific information, typically regarding others with whom he is associated. Though he could develop this further, he has been reticent to engage with Magic any more than required. While the information may at times be useful, the constant onslaught has rendered his memory more fickle than it otherwise would be, with details from the past becoming slowly engulfed by the constant new.

                 Having actively contended with the inundation of unwanted knowledge Magically funneled directly to his mind for over a decade, stone has built up a notable resistance to various Magics. Through a combination of sheer willpower and constant, forced practice, stone is simply not as susceptible to Magic as others may be. While this may be beneficial in regard to harmful Magic, his resistance also affects helpful Magic, such as healing. While he might be able to override this resistance intentionally, his own bias against Magic makes him unlikely to do so, even in his favour.

                 Though he only bears them through some parts of the year, stone's antlers are his most formidible weapon. Comprised of dead bone, they cannot be injured even if they are broken, and their strength makes this unlikely. While they do not come to a fine point, they are sharp enough to pierce flesh, though their true power comes from the force behind them: once someone is faced with his antlers, they then must contend with all the force of his ire. His body was made for this.

                 Deer are remarkable in their ability to escape situations through agility and speed. While typically stone will elect simply to run, he will jump as needed throughout. While running, he is able to jump over 2 meters/6.5 feet in height and 6 meters/19.7 feet in length, though this ability is reduced when jumping from a standing or walking position.

A more average running speed is around 65 kph/40.4 mph, and he can maintain a fairly comfortable 35 kph/21.7 mph for a significant distance before tiring. In addition to this speed, he is able to quickly dodge and weave without stumbling, easily evading trees and attackers alike.

This sense can extend up to eight-hundred meters, or half a mile. Scent is their primary method of communication, with species possessing several varied forms of scent communication such as urine via self-anointing, feces, salivary deposits, and several glands potentially associated with scent called the sudoriferous (forehead), preorbital (inner eye), nasal (nose), preputial (male genitals), tarsal (inner hindlegs), metatarsal (outer hindlegs), and interdigital (between toes). He freely utilizes all of these which he possesses to the fullest extent of his capacity with no regard for others' social norms, and consequently may come off as a bit… Smelly.

               <p align="left">
                 Due to their eye structure, deer have a type of dichromatic colour vision called protanopia. He can distinguish blue from red, but not green or orange from red, and also sees colours like light gray and tan better than dark reds, browns, or greens. On the contrary, he sees colours in the blue spectrum—including into the ultraviolet range—up to twenty times more distinctly than humans can, likely because this is the most prevalent spectrum of light during the crepuscular periods, when deer tend to be most active. His horizontal pupils allow for nine times the light absorption of the human eye, leading to night vision at least eighteen times greater than a human's and a roughly 310° field of view, including about 65° of binocular frontal vision providing depth perception, and lacking only about 50° immediately behind him; this allows him to track the motion of anything within his field of view, which is about 85% of his eye-level surroundings, without moving. His vision is processed at least twice as fast as a human's, giving him hyper-sensitivity to movement and ample time to react. However, with little need for acuity of detail, his vision is only about a third as detailed as a human's, measured at 6/18 (metric) or 20/60 (imperial).

               <p align="left">
                 Deer have a hearing range similar to that of humans: a human's most sensitive range is from 2 to 5 kHz, and an overall range from 0.02 to 20 kHz; a deer's most sensitive range is from 1 to 8 kHz, and an overall range from 0.25 to 30 kHz. Deer can hear ultrasonic high-frequency sounds that humans cannot, and can utilize the muscles in their ears to target the source of a sound with precision. Deer are capable of independently rotating their ears nearly 180°, allowing their cupped shape to funnel sound from opposite directions simultaneously. His hearing is average for his subspecies, though he has learned the importance of certain sounds and the spoken word.

                 Having used rock balancing to distract himself from the influx of knowledge, stone has gained a unique degree of dexterity for a deer. In addition, though he has always been fairly patient, he has learned to take his time to analyse a situation fully and completely before acting—when time allows—which lends him the ability to see things which may have been overlooked by others tackling things quickly.
