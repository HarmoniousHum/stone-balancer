	<span class="tooltip-marker" onclick="">Natural Rut Notes</span>
		<div id="disclaimer" class="tooltip">
			<p>The sangai naturally ruts from early February through early May. Despite participating in the annual Rut Event in autumn, stone's biological clock dictates that he ruts from the Northern Hemisphere's mid-Winter to mid-Spring. Since he is one of the only denizens rutting in The Forest at this time to my knowledge, he may attempt to hide the behaviour, as it's mistimed in The Endless Forest; however, he still has all the instincts of a stag in rut, and it will often come out in his personality across this period.</p>
			
			<p>The most violent months for sangai are February and March, when the stags display and fight to establish territories and harems. Due to this, stone's temper is often short at this time. He becomes territorial and protective&mdash;even possessive, if it's allowed of him. His herding instinct becomes much stronger toward anyone not perceived as a rival or threat, with him particularly attracted to other feral/semi-feral deer. He is prone to mood swings&mdash;positive and negative&mdash;and tends to become depressed when left alone without conflict or company. To sum him up: he is quick to judge during this time, and while he seeks to form a group which he will protect at nearly all costs, he is also rather aggressive and prone to conflict. His prejudice toward beings who are not feral/semi-feral deer decreases during this time, however, he may be more biased toward those he perceives as threats than usual.</p>
			
			<p>Late March is the peak period of the rut for sangai; after this point, mating has typically begun and males are generally less aggressive. Likewise, stone generally becomes more patient and docile, though retains his strong herding instinct through the remainder of his rut. At this point, his viewpoint is typically "the more the merrier", so long as the individual is friendly and doesn't make the group vulnerable. While initially he is quick to display aggression, late March triggers courting behaviour in him. When welcomed, he will court most receptive beings, simply because it comes naturally to him. This means lavishing attention on others in an effort to "butter them up". While feral in this regard, he also possesses a notion of "honour", so anything unwanted need not be worried over. During this time, he lives to please; he seeks to impress, to be noble and strong and desirable. He makes every effort to expand the pool of individuals who like and admire him, and will do almost anything on their behalves. To sum him up: his herd is not a thing he possesses, but rather a group of individuals placed on a pedestal, who he aims to impress and win over with every fiber of his being. Any previous notions of possessiveness were simply an effort to have an audience to pamper, and he dedicates himself to it entirely. His prejudice toward beings who are not feral/semi-feral deer is decreased for the remainder of his rutting period, though he remains protective should a perceived threat present itself.</p>

			<p>Having just concluded his rut, stone is in his physical prime (though often fairly lean) at this time and has already been making a concerted effort at forming and providing for his herd. This leads naturally into the Spring Rally event, and stone finds himself amiable towards it, even if he feels he may have been ready for it a bit earlier than it always comes.</p>

				</figcaption>
			<p>Given his species, he does not naturally rut at this time&mdash;however, with the pheromones surging throughout the Forest, he finds his own testosterone levels elevated in turn, and his behaviour reflects that. He is in a state of pseudo-rut, desperate to impress, both to gain respect and for the possibility of breeding. He will court virtually any female, try to impress anyone, and bluff or even fight nearly anyone for the sake of winning or protecting those in his harem. His antlers are shed relatively recently prior to the Rut Event, so he may appear less than desirable/threatening to others.</p>
		
			<p>Though he is normally prejudiced against non-deer species, while rutting, he becomes conspicuously more open to herding with just about anyone receptive to him. He is exceptionally attracted to feral does, particularly of purely cervine origins. While he hopes one day to encounter another sangai, he's concluded he's unlikely to ever meet with his own subspecies again. He is more than open to the idea of breeding with virtually any willing female who he's capable of mounting, but he is only capable of siring offspring with his own species. (I wish I had more data on this because hybridization is likely possible, but little research seems to have been done on it, so I am limiting his ability to what I know for certain.)</p>
	
			<p>While living in the Forest, he's gathered a herd of friends. If he feels like anyone is being aggressed unnecessarily, he will not hesitate to tell them off for the sake of continuing or expanding his own social circle. While it does not come naturally to him to assimilate into a herd belonging to another in a social rank above his own, he now possesses the mental faculties to ignore his instinct should this benefit him or those close to him. He will, however, strongly tend toward forming his own herd&mdash;he is incredibly prideful.</p>
	
			<p>He is an experienced fighter. Though initially his body was old and beyond its prime, his body has forgotten his earlier frailty; the many years he's seen have not come without experience, and he makes a formidable opponent. Should he choose to stand against another, he should not be taken lightly. Ultimately, this is all quite unlikely however, as like any feral stag, he far prefers to bluff than to come to blows.</p>

				<h4>Quick Facts</h4>
				<ul id="quick-facts">
					<li> <em>Old</em>. Given to long, frequent periods of rest partially due to age, mostly due to lethargy. </li>
					<li> <em>Wild</em>. Largely a feral animal. Behaves primarily according to biological needs and desires. </li>
					<li> <em>Proud</em>. Strives to be respected and regarded as reliable. Confident and easily offended when dismissed. </li>
					<li> <em>Casual</em>. Acknowledges others by looking at them with no reaction, or sniffing them, then returning to what he was doing&mdash;this is a means of displaying approval. </li>
					<li> <em>Voiced</em>. Speaks aloud to communicate, as a human would; has modified anatomy to do this, caused by Forest Magic. </li>
					<li> <em>Natural</em>.  Equally capable of feral communication, however is limited by species, being more accurate and detailed with those of closer taxonomic relation. </li>
					<li> <em>Purposed</em>. Driven to be the protector and provider he feels stags live to be. Protective to a fault; views himself as the, if necessary, expendable protector of his herd. </li>
					<li> <em>Reserved</em>. Does not bow, considering it too "unnatural". May use similar gestures&mdash;such as nodding&mdash;though these actions are performed with an unusual curtness. </li>
					<li> <em>Enduring</em>. No longer physically ages since entering The Forest; all bodily characteristics are unknowingly governed by his belief alone, be that to his favour or detriment. </li>
					<li> <em>Nostalgic</em>. Often found at the Pond or in the Birch Forest—they remind him of home. </li>
					<li> <em>Perceptive</em>. Capable of spontaneously understanding virtually anything via Forest Magic; feels distinctly ambivalent toward this. </li>
					<li> <em>Prejudiced</em>. Distinctly hates having, using, or receiving enchantment spells, especially those which more drastically alter his appearance. Will never participate in Magic. </li>
					<li> <em>Mistrustful</em>. Tends to avoid areas he associates with Forest Magic, such as the Twin Gods and the Old Oak. Also tends to avoid the Ruins without a real reason. </li>
					<li> <em>Companionable</em>. Considers others around him to be herd-company, even at a distance. Often reliant upon socialization and camaraderie. </li>

							<p>Winter coat begins to show through in mid-September, and is fully developed by the beginning of November. The process gradually grows more noticable, with the change being incremental and not a dramatic shift. While fur is overall much denser during cooler months, the fur on the neck is particularly thicker and coarser than bodily fur, lending to the appearance of a mane which is also somewhat darker than the fur on the body. Colours are overall darker and desaturated; colouration is somewhat inconsistently patchy across the body.</p>

						flank spots.
						<br>
							<p>Begins to shed Winter coat in late April, and will be in Summer coat by the beginning of June. The process is very obvious, with patches of thick fur coming out in clumps, and a generally scruffy appearance across May. Fur is overall much thinner and less insulative during the warmer months. Colouration is somewhat more uniform reddish-orange across the body, and there are the distinct presence of fawn-like pale spots on the flank.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Year-round coat qualities</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Smooth, thin fur with thin and sparse underfur; uneven hair length resulting in a shaggy appearance. Fur inside the ears is very long and smooth, almost silky but still somewhat rigid. Fur is speckled with gray overall, having lost pigmentation over the years; fur continues to grow more gray over time due to stress, but this pigmentation loss is reversed in times of calm when body chemistry returns to homeostasis.</p>

Ranges from ~100 kg/~220 lbs to ~130 kg/~287 lbs based around season and activity level.
					</dd>
					<dt>Reproductive traits</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Antlers may begin being shed at end of June, and will be shed by the beginning of September; antlers are free of velvet between late December and early January. Neck muscles begin to visibly strengthen as soon as the velvet is shed, are at their peak size by early March, and return to normal size by early May. Rut period is from late January through early May, with the peak fighting months being late February and March; urinates on himself through rut period.</p>
					
						<p>Though he is theoretically capable of breeding with any fertile female deer, I limit his reproductive capacity to his own species (preferably subspecies, though species is logical), though he's comfortable mating with most females of many cervid or cervid-like species. He will only mate during his own natural rut or The Rut event (as it sparks the same physiological reaction within him due to pheromones triggering his own hormones). He may still court outside of these periods, however.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Smell</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Much like that of a dog, a deer's sense of smell can be up to 1000 times greater than that of a human, with deer being able to distinguish up to six individual scents at once. This sense can extend up to roughly 800 meters or half a mile.</p>
						
						<p>Smell is a primary method of communication for deer, with species possessing several varied forms of scent communication such as urine or feces, salivary deposits, or a number of scent-producing glands called the preorbital, forehead, tarsal, and interdigital. Stone freely utilizes all of these to the fullest extent of his capacity with absolutely no regard for social norms, and consequently may come off as a bit&hellip; Smelly.</p>
					<dt>Hearing</dt>
					<dd>Despite appearances, deer hear roughly as well as humans do, and he is no different. A human's most sensitive range is from 2,000 to 5,000 hertz, and a deer's most sensitive range is from 3,000 to 8,000 hertz. However, deer can hear ultra-high-frequency sounds humans cannot, and can utilize the muscles in their ears to target the source of a sound with precision.</p>
					<dt>Vision</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Due to eye structure, deer are basically red-green colourblind; based on my current understanding, he has <a href="https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/62282849_4tV0v058z0Z3ioP.jpg" target="_blank">protanopic colour vision</a>. He can distinguish blue from red, but not green or orange from red. He also sees colours like light gray and tan better than dark reds, browns, or greens. On the contrary, he sees colours in the blue spectrum much more distinctly than humans can, most likely because this is the most prevalent spectrum of light during the crepuscular periods, when deer tend to be most active. He can also see further into the ultraviolet spectrum than human eyes can, though none of it appears to glow, he simply has a broader access to that range of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
						
						<p>His horizonal pupils allow for nine times the light absorption of the human eye, leading to incredible night vision and a roughly 310&#176; field of view, including about 65&#176; of binocular frontal vision providing depth perception, and lacking only about 50&#176; immediately behind him. This also allows him to track the motion of anything within his field of view, which is about 85% of his eye-level surroundings, without moving a muscle.</p>
						
						<p>His vision is processed at least twice as fast as that of a human, giving him hyper-sensitivity to movement and ample time for reaction. However, with little need for acuity of detail, his vision is only about 6/18 (metric), 20/60 (imperial), or a third as detailed as a human's.</p>
					<dt>Age</dt>
					<dd>Though he was born in 2004 and is a member of a species whose wild lifespan only averages ten years, stone is much older than this. Since he arrived in The Endless Forest at nine years and four months old, he has not truly aged. His body now is only affected by his belief, though he is unaware of this. When he initially arrived, he felt old, and so his joints were frequently sore and he grew tired rather quickly. When he is stressed, his fur grows in grayed; when he is injured, he limps and feels pain. However, as time has gone on, he's forgotten some of his age, and has come closer to how he once was in his prime. In times of peace, his fur grows vibrant; his body seldom aches; he finds himself energetic as long as he believes it true. Though unaware of it, he has become timeless since entering, and is only affected so much as he believes himself to be.</p>
					<dt>Posture</dt>
					<dd>Head is generally held high, not in a challenging manner but rather with the stance of an individual already in a position of importance. Bodily posture ranges from tense but confident to relaxed and open; very rarely displays any form of submission. Ears are typically relaxed; back is never hunched; tail generally hangs loosely; hooves are splayed in a manner suited to walking through marshes and swamps.</dd>

				<h3>Personality</h3>
			</header>
			<section>
				<p>Quite non-confrontational, he is content to lie down most of the time, watching younger deer participate in their endeavours. He is ambivalent toward the intellect he acquired upon entering the Forest due to its magical source: on one hand, he enjoys being able to reason to the degree he now can, to think and deduce and understand; on the other hand, he never asked for it, and he cannot forgive the Magic for putting it upon him. As a result of his contempt, he does not let his mind wander idly&mdash;that is when the knowledge comes to him in full force. His method for coping with and staving off the knowledge is to occupy his body and mind with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_balancing" target="_blank">rock balancing</a>. Though not particularly good at it&mdash;he is, after all, using his mouth&mdash;he devotes much of the time not spent on the upkeep of his body and socialization to carefully constructing these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairn" target="_blank">cairns</a>. He does not keep track of their height or even where he builds them, as this would be too mindful for his tastes. He does not mind if something happens to them, even while he's building them; he does not bond to his craft, only uses it as a tool of distraction. He merely collects some stones by his side and sets to work, leaving when he is satisfied.</p>
				<p>Though he is often at rest, it is not purely because of his age. It's true that, for his species, he has passed his prime&mdash;however, his body is still more capable than he lets on. Any soreness is largely from his idle tendencies, and he can still outpace many with less experience. Ultimately, he's just fallen into a habit of lethargy.</p>
				<p>Being a feral creature, his personality is greatly altered by his hormones and physiological state. He is at his most vulnerable when he is without solid antlers.  He is prone to wary behaviour around others, but has calmed down significantly as he's gone on living in The Forest. He finds safety when in the presence of those he trusts, and will stand up for himself or others in proper company. When alone, he wanders about seeking trustworthy company, avoiding and fleeing from that which he does not consider to be such. Rarely though does he truly fear anything now that he has grown accustomed to the Forest.</p>
				<p>In contrast, when his antlers are grown, he tends to be quite confident in himself, but not brash or overzealous. His confidence is felt as a certain self-possession, and he is as close to objective in his analysis of whether it is wise to fight, flee, or freeze as he can be in this physiological state. This state of mind is the closest to his most base personality of all those governed by his physiological states.</p>
				<p>Continuing on to the extreme, when his rutting period comes about/the Forest about him is in rut, he goes from being docile and unassuming to audacious and uninhibited. While not a stupid being, he's more likely to make rash decisions when his testosterone levels are higher.</p>
				<p>Along with his rut comes an amplified sense of his responsibility to fill his role as the "patriarch" of a herd. He is the guardian, the provider; he must always be steadfast and reliable, to help and protect those for whom he deems himself responsible. From his perspective, it is his legacy to devote himself to a cause bigger than himself: the safety and comfort of others, and the continuation of his herd. Even while not in rut, this is a constant aspect of his personality which will come out when others are vulnerable, or others try to help him&mdash;though he will always be grateful for efforts made on his behalf.</p>
				<p>According to his feral history, he is a herd animal through and through, and welcomes company; whether at some distance or up close, he is far more comfortable and at ease with others. That said, he does prefer a bit of distance while getting to know someone, and may settle himself away from those so eager to befriend him that they do not give him personal space. He is also seasonally prone to preferring large herds, smaller herds, or occasionally even solitude.</p>
				<p>Contrary to his usual attitude toward the intellect granted to him by Forest Magic, he enjoys conversation, learning about others' experiences and thoughts, and even enjoys speaking himself (he can be exceedingly verbose around anyone he is fond of, though over time his chatter has lessened). This is because it is not knowledge which truly upsets him, but the manner in which he comes to possess it: it is the Magic of the Forest, not his developed awareness, which bothers him. He is perfectly at ease with all things he considers "natural", including thinking, speaking, and manipulating his environment, as he did all of these things back home to the best of his ability. These things, to him, are rooted in the "natural"&mdash;that is to say, they are physical, non-magical things which are Earthly in nature. For this reason he enjoys learning about the world around him and possessing his new-found intellect. However, given that the origins of his reasoning are still seated in the Magic of the Forest, he finds himself burdened by conflicting thoughts and feelings&mdash;comfortable with the nature of the Forest, but repulsed by the Magic at its core.</p>
				<p>It is of note that the stone balancer actually does quite literally speak, aloud, as a human would. Upon entering the Forest, his body was instantly modified to suit the demands which were put upon it: his brain became more complex, to allow room for more developed thought and storage; and his vocal cords shifted and grew to resemble those of a human, while his anatomy was modified to produce human language. He considers all spoken languages to be the same "language" cognitively, simplifying them to himself as merely "talking". In other words, while he can become instantly aware of the pronunciation and meaning of any word in any spoken language, he does not recognize words in different languages as being in different groups, and instead merely perceives that there are many equally valid ways to vocalize singular concepts.</p>
				<p>When not "talking", he communicates in the feral ways one would expect of a deer: scent, body language, non-word vocalizations, and the like. He is, however, only capable of communicating perfectly&mdash;albeit simplistically&mdash;with members of his own subspecies in this way. When communicating in a feral manner with members of other species, miscommunication is common due to differences between vocal, visual, and olfactory cues. Simply put, different species communicate differently, and he is still limited to his own feral capacity in this regard.</p>
				<p>As he's gone on living in The Forest, he's worked on coming to terms with his circumstances, and his herd has been imperative to that. Though he will <em>always</em> resent the Forest Magic for taking him from his home (if it did&mdash;he thinks so), forcing intelligence upon him, and continually feeding him information without his desire or consent, he's come to love many of the beings he knows here, the fact that he can think to the degree he can, and what his life has become as a whole. He will never be completely satisfied, and he will always be disapproving of most residents of the Forest, but given a chance to go back now, if he had to give up his new herd and his intelligence, he wouldn't. That alone speaks volumes of how he's changed since he first arrived.</p>
				<p>Though he prefers the company of others, there are some beings which he may be wary of, or in some situations, even reject outright. These sorts include: his natural predators, or animals which he recognizes as formidable and omnivorous/carnivorous; beings intent on instigating ruckus in play or otherwise; beings which are in some manner a specific degree or beyond "unnatural", including human-faced beings, "unnaturally" coloured beings, beings with accessories or other decorative features which are not an aspect of their own body, hybrids of two or more species which cannot reproduce without the aid of Magic/science/etc, highly deformed beings; extremely large beings, even if appearing neutral; beings which appear sickly or somehow dead/undead; beings very deeply rooted in their intellectuality and/or strange societal traditions (human-like or otherwise); beings who highly associate themselves with Forest Magic; etc. Especially considering the length of the list, this is merely an example of beings which he may initially be wary of, but can easily warm up to over time. He is not usually mistrustful due to others being somehow "wrong", but more specifically is made uncomfortable by how their appearance and/or behaviour may negatively impact him. (E.g. an animal with a very bright pelt would, where he's from, attract the attention of predators, and he's initially hesitant to associate with such a "target" animal.) It is important to note that, like with other aspects of his personality, he's become much more open-minded since his arrival, and is tending toward more and more acceptance all the time, with regard to life events.</p>
				<p>Contrastingly, he is to some degree or another drawn to some entities upon first meeting them, including: benevolent or neutral spirits/deities/mythological creatures and the like (I headcanon that animals on Earth are generally innately aware and at peace with such beings, and that these beings are entirely separate from the Magic of the Forest/Twin Gods); exceptionally peaceful beings; "natural" beings&mdash;especially but not limited to deer&mdash;which are generally herbivorous; female two-toed hoofed beings (particularly cervines), for obvious instinctual reasons, as well as that a good portion of his Earthly life was spent protecting his harem and their offspring; etc. Again, obviously, this is only an example of the sorts of beings he'll find himself drawn to.</p>
				<p>He will, generally, treat all in-forest actions and appearances as they seem to be in-game. For example, when he receives any form of Spell, he experiences that change literally, to some extent. (e.g. The peacock pelt results in him being covered in peacock feathers in the same pattern as an actual peacock.) He can remove all Magic by some means or another (e.g. taking off masks, breaking off antlers, pulling out feathers) and this process is always painless. In fact, Magic produces no physical sensation for him, but can be quite time-consuming to remove bit by bit. As soon as the Magic is removed, it disappears&mdash;unless it's willed by him to stay. Rather than meticulously groom Magic off of himself, he often uses the Pond to "wash off" Magic, as he's observed its tendency to remove spells. Ultimately, he perceives the Forest thus: all "unnatural" things (e.g. spells, glitches, etc) are viewed as some form of Magic; he generally perceives a being to look like its set implies due to his poor eyesight, and is only granted clarity if I elect to research the character (understandably, this can lead to some interesting misconceptions, and his behaviour will reflect his current understanding); we assume the least detrimental result of his actions until shown otherwise (e.g. if he bares his antlers to a character, I assume he is merely trying to intimidate them and they have not been harmed, unless the player chooses to have their character suffer a wound); etc. On top of that, movements such as tripping or walking through trees are also perceived literally. (Basically, I only alter his perception of The Forest to suit his character and when I'm not certain how to translate it.)</p>
				<p>Interestingly, despite his distaste for Magic, he is exceedingly fond of the Pond and, to a lesser extent, the Crying Idol, despite their obviously Magical ties. This is due to the fact that the Pond is capable of removing all Magic, and that the Magic granted by the Crying Idol differs from all other Forest Magic (Spells cannot be cast upon those who bear its pelt). While he still prefers things of a non-Magical nature, these areas of the Forest are distinctly different to him. He has come to regard De Drinkplaats with mixed feelings; while it does remove Magic, it also generates its own. Despite this, he is especially fond of the area it occupies&mdash;particularly the most grassy areas of the Birch&mdash;and has come to tolerate it for this reason.</p>
				<p>Having come from essentially a swamp, he spends much of his time in or around the Pond and stream. At the Pond, he occupies himself with drinking, eating water plants (a personal favourite of his), and wallowing in the muddy shore water. He may at times spend hours just laying or even sleeping in the water at the shoreline, and has grown fond of watching some of the smaller animals which frequent the area. His homeland also strongly resembled the Birch Forest away from the water's edge, and thus he is happy to spend days simply wandering through it. In general, he may be found bathing in the Pond, resting near the Crying Idol, grazing the blueberries in the Blue Bowl, lounging in the tall grasses near De Drinkplaats, or observing the Forest from Red Hill.</p>

					<dt>Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Having maintained the canon aspect of the Forest in that deer who have logged off disappear in a puff of purple mist/smoke, this is the written form of how stone explains to himself where others go when not present but not aware of where they are.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>[The] Dark Place</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>This is stone's personal "Where-the-Sleeping-Ones-Go". Though at first unaware of his own existence when not in the Forest, eventually stone came to be aware of the place in-between Forest manifestations. As "time" progresses from his arrival here in each visit, he is able to perceive more about it. It seems to differ greatly visit to visit, not unlike the landscape of a dream; however, it is always comforting, infinite in possibility but conforming to desire, and generally utopian. Though he does not physically age while he is present here, his body does continue to go through its other natural processes accordingly, e.g. he sheds and regrows his antlers consistent with his natural cycle in accordance to real-world Earth time. He is otherwise put into a state of physical stasis in which he is kept in perfect health&mdash;which is to say he is perfectly nourished, hydrated, and rested at all times&mdash;and thus heals very quickly here. It is, basically, a dream-like pocket dimension which shifts based upon his perception and keeps him perfectly healthy.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Limbo</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The state in which stone is in the Forest, but alone. Though a bit lonely, he finds this state to be very peaceful, and actually experiences this place as different from the connected Forest in that he does not hurt here at all and his Pictogram can be missing. He finds himself here whenever I cannot connect or get disconnected.</p>

				<h3>Behaviour</h3>
			</header>
			<section>
				<p>Due to Manipur Eld's deer being so endangered, little research has been done on their social behaviour; his extended body language is thus based on the behaviour of other species.</p>
				
				<p>Typically, the stone balancer will behave amiably, maintaining a sort of cautious acceptance. He does react negatively to certain set items (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> Zombie set items, DotD set items, etc.), which is an assumption about the character based on the items which are used to represent them. I will generally try to locate the character's biography via the map prior to/during interaction, so his behaviour may change to reflect his current perception.</p>
				
				<p>His behaviour is a combination of his natural behaviour as an animal, what he finds reasonable with his intellect, and certain social body language he's adopted from other members of the Forest. He is, however, very picky about body language, and absolutely will not use certain gestures, such as bowing.</p>

				<p>He may come off as rude, abrasive, or aloof due to his tendency to err on the side of caution. He far prefers to run or be standoffish if he knows it will keep him and others safe.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Body Language</h4>
				<dl id="body-language">
					<dt>Initial Response:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Upon first meeting another, he will look at them from his current bodily position, moving only his head while doing so. He will hold a stare for a few seconds while he evaluates them based on their behaviour, set items, company, and biography&mdash;if I've seen it.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>= Ambivalence/Impartiality:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Often times, he neither accepts nor rejects another outright. In this period, he'll exhibit somewhat in-between signals, though none are intended to be ambiguous.</p>
					
						<div class="summary-terms">
							<p><dfn>Indecision</dfn>: Body held at about a sixty degree angle toward the other, neither aggressive nor fearful, but not comfortable.</p>
							<p><dfn>Respect/cautious acceptance/”I don't want trouble”</dfn>: Standing with his side to the other at about a ninety degree angle, his gaze averted.</p>
						</div>
					</dd>
					<dt>+ Acceptance:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>If he accepts the other but their acknowledgement is brief, he will then return to what he was doing, reassured that he does not need to pay close attention to them.</p>
					
						<p>If they express friendly behaviour (bowing, sniffing, any other amiable behaviour), he will return with a sniff and maybe a curt nod if he thinks the sniff does not suffice. If no further action is taken by them, he will return to what he was doing, even more assured than he otherwise would have been.</p>
					
						<p>If they attempt to engage in further amiable behaviour, his own behaviour will be his version of that same degree of acceptance. He welcomes all friendly company, to varying degrees. He never ignores a friendly being, and will only turn one away if he thinks they are truly dangerous and he cannot trust them, though he may also be aloof with those who he takes qualms with but does not fear.</p>
					
						<div class="summary-terms">
							<p><dfn>Trust</dfn>: He will graze, drink, and bathe around the other, putting himself in positions of vulnerability.</p>
							<p><dfn>Complete trust</dfn>: He will lie down and sleep around the other, and feels no need to observe their actions whilst awake. (Take with a grain of salt, as I also inadvertently let him fall asleep.)</p>
						</div>
					</dd>
					<dt>- Rejection:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Things can go negatively in two ways: a flight reaction (cautious/fearful), or a fight reaction (defensive/aggressive). Stone sets his own health above virtually everything, and thus will almost always flee from any perceived confrontation. His exceptions to this rule are: when defending another being, when he is in rut or a pseudo-rut, and when he knows that fleeing will not help him.</p>

						<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogcd91-h0Mo" target="_blank">Documentary</a>.</p>
						<p>
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur" target="_blank">Manipur, India</a>—the southeastern portion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loktak_Lake" target="_blank">Loktak Lake</a>, among the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phumdi" target="_blank">phumdis</a>.
						</p>
						<p>Heralding from a protected area (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keibul_Lamjao_National_Park" target="_blank">Keibul Lamjao National Park</a>) created due to the low numbers of Manipur Eld's deer, he and his herd rarely faced predation by humans, and were given some protection by them from other natural predators as well. As one of the older members of his herd, he had given up his place as one of the dominant stags in the breeding season before coming to the Forest. Despite this, in his prime, he sired many fawns and led his own harems. Though past his prime, his antlers are still quite impressive due to his age, and he's had a fair deal of experience, so he knows plenty of tricks if need be, and has certainly not given up on courting and showing off.</p>
						<p>While he was originally a purely feral deer led almost entirely by instinct and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia" target="_blank">qualia</a>, upon being brought to the Forest he was granted intellectual awareness of the world by "Forest Magic", resulting in essentially a human level of cognition. In the Forest, he finds himself aware of language, logic, complex cultural beliefs and behaviours, a gist of the overall nature of the world, the greater implications of cause and effect and the problems which may follow current paths of action, and other general data-based knowledge. So long as he keeps his mind idle, busied by unimportant tasks, the knowledge will not come; however, if he focuses his attention upon something, awareness of details relating to it come flooding into his mind via that Magic. Though he has come to terms with the nature of the Forest and his new-found intellect, he still strains to keep touch with his feral past, and to resist embracing the knowledge and its source.</p>
						<p>Born on November 11th, 2004. Entered The Endless Forest in March, 2014. Entered Reach of the River on August 2, 2023.</p>

								<div class="tooltip"><em>"<s>My charge. My reassurance.</s> My son."</em> Comfortable with; considers an ally; feral company; exceptionally fond of; interested in; protective of. Thinking fondly back to when Rune, barely older than a newborn, first snuggled up to him for warmth at the Pond, stone considers him a son. He feels a special tie to him not shared with his "sisters," since stone was the first to bond with the buck. Stone takes comfort in his very feral appearance and is comforted by his cautious nature, in that he ought to do well for himself with it. Like many, Rune is a scarce but welcome blessing, and will always be held dear to stone as one of his most rudimentary herd-mates.</div>

								<a class="tooltip-marker" href="/community/node/95009" target="_blank" onclick="">Stria</a>
								<div class="tooltip"><em>"<s>My onus. My young equal.</s> My daughter."</em> Admires; bewildered by; exceptionally comfortable with; considers an ally; entertained by; frustrated by; exceptionally fond of; interested in; learning from; protected by; protective of; respects. Present for and bonded since Stria's birth, he witnessed a good portion of her growth in her early days before his increased absences, and considers her a daughter. Though he's not always been the fondest of her decisions in company or life progress, he's always supported her the best he can even where he cannot understand her. Regardless of his concerns, she's grown to be more physically capable even than he, and he's finally come to realize she does not need his protection anymore; regardless, whether she wants it or not, she still has it. She is constantly there to press at him and force him to face the world, encounter new things, and challenge old ideas; he is there to impart his own knowledge upon her and guide her where he can, if needed, though not always wanted. It is no longer about what he should do for her, and is instead about what they will do for one another.</div>

								<div class="tooltip">Attracted to; very comfortable with; feral company; fond of; protective of. A now familiar face, stone appreciates her restful nature, as she seems to help put the herd—and himself—at ease. As he's discovered, she's not opposed to bouts of play, which has greatly earned his favour.</div>

								<div class="tooltip">Admires; comfortable with; considers an ally; feral company; fond of; interested in; protected by; protective of; respects. An old and close friend for whom stone's fondness remains no matter what length of time passes between their meeting.

A bit more commonly seen than many of the other ferals, he's relieved by her reliable companionship.

								<div class="tooltip">Admires; comfortable with; considers an ally; entertained by; feral company; fond of. Despite knowing relatively little about him, stone is entirely biased toward red deer as a species now, and Ruun appears to be about as feral as himself. A pleasant reprieve.</div>

A relatively new face, though he is always thrilled to welcome feral deer to the Forest and as his friend. Doesn't know much about her, but is always happy to see her. Despite a few meetings so far, has not yet gotten to know her, but is interested in doing so one of these days.</div>
